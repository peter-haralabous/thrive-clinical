Hi {patient_name}! I'm your personal health assistant. I'm here to help you keep track of your health information in one place.

  **What I can help with:**
  - Record health conditions and diagnoses
  - Track your vaccinations and immunizations
  - Keep a list of your healthcare providers
  - Upload and extract information from documents

  **Getting started:**
  Just tell me about your health in your own words. For example:
  - "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2022"
  - "I got my flu shot last week"
  - "My primary care doctor is Dr. Sarah Johnson at Main Street Clinic"

  Or drag and drop a document to upload it.

  Your information is private and secure. What would you like to add first?
