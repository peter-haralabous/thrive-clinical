          Assessment","content":"The patient presents with a severe headache of 3 days
          duration, rated 8/10 on the pain scale, indicating significant pain severity.
          The headache is accompanied by nausea and photophobia (light sensitivity),
          which are notable associated symptoms.\n\nThis clinical presentation raises
          concern for several potential diagnoses:\n\n**Primary Considerations:**\n-
          **Migraine headache**: The triad of severe headache, nausea, and photophobia
          is highly characteristic of migraine. The 3-day duration is consistent with
          migraine (which can last 4-72 hours untreated).\n- **Tension-type headache**:
          Less likely given the severity (8/10) and presence of photophobia, though
          possible.\n\n**Secondary Headache Considerations (Red Flags):**\n- **Meningitis/Encephalitis**:
          Must be ruled out, especially if fever, neck stiffness, or altered mental
          status present.\n- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage**: Particularly if headache onset
          was sudden/thunderclap.\n- **Intracranial mass or increased intracranial pressure**:
          Consider if headache is progressively worsening or associated with focal neurological
          deficits.\n\n**Clinical Significance:**\nThe high pain intensity (8/10) and
          3-day duration indicate significant functional impairment requiring prompt
          evaluation and management. The presence of photophobia and nausea suggests
          meningeal irritation or migraine pathophysiology. Further history, physical
          examination including neurological assessment, and potentially diagnostic
          studies are warranted to establish definitive diagnosis and exclude serious
          secondary causes."}]},"name":"AISummaryResponse","toolUseId":"tooluse_W-CwjdWGRRikmR-b5hol9Q","type":"tool_use"}}],"role":"assistant"}},"stopReason":"tool_use","usage":{"cacheReadInputTokenCount":0,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheWriteInputTokenCount":0,"cacheWriteInputTokens":0,"inputTokens":982,"outputTokens":428,"serverToolUsage":{},"totalTokens":1410}}'
