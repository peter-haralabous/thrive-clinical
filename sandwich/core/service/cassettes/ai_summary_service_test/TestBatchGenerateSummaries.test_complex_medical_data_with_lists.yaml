          Allergies\n\n**Documented Allergies:**\n\n* Penicillin (Reaction: Anaphylaxis)\n*
          Shellfish (Reaction: Hives)\n* Latex (Reaction: Contact dermatitis)\n\n**Clinical
          Significance:**\n\nThe patient has three documented allergies with varying
          severity levels that require careful consideration in treatment planning:\n\n*
          **Penicillin allergy with anaphylaxis** represents a severe, life-threatening
          Type I hypersensitivity reaction. This necessitates strict avoidance of all
          penicillin-based antibiotics and related beta-lactam agents. Alternative antibiotic
          classes (e.g., macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or non-beta-lactam alternatives)
          should be utilized when antimicrobial therapy is indicated. The patient should
          wear medical alert identification and have emergency epinephrine readily available.\n\n*
          **Shellfish allergy with urticarial reaction** indicates IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.
          While primarily a dietary concern, this allergy has potential implications
          for contrast media administration, as some older iodinated contrast agents
          were shellfish-derived. Current evidence suggests iodine allergy itself is
          not the issue, but heightened vigilance and pre-medication protocols should
          be considered for contrast studies.\n\n* **Latex contact dermatitis** suggests
          Type IV delayed hypersensitivity. Latex-free gloves, equipment, and surgical
          supplies must be used during all procedures and examinations. Operating room
          protocols should designate latex-free environments to prevent exposure.\n\nAll
          healthcare providers, including emergency personnel, surgical teams, and pharmacy
          staff, must be notified of these allergies prior to any interventions."]},"name":"AISummaryResponse","toolUseId":"tooluse_BYCm5BiGS1eBnRtcOSC_aA","type":"tool_use"}}],"role":"assistant"}},"stopReason":"tool_use","usage":{"cacheReadInputTokenCount":0,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheWriteInputTokenCount":0,"cacheWriteInputTokens":0,"inputTokens":968,"outputTokens":433,"serverToolUsage":{},"totalTokens":1401}}'
