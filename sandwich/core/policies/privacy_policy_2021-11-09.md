### Location of Services

While your personal health information is stored securely in Canada, we make use of the following 3rd party applications for specific functions that enable or support our platform.

#### [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Canada)
We use Amazon Web Services to provide infrastructure services to host our software platform. Our platform hosting within AWS is contained with their CA-Central region, which is geographically located in Canada. Our business agreement with AWS prevents Amazon from accessing your data that is stored on the Thrive platform. In addition we encrypt your data using encryption keys that we control.

#### [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (USA)
Auth0 provides our user account management and authentication system. If you have created a Thrive Health account your email address and a cryptographic hash of your password are stored in Auth0. None of your health information is shared with Auth0. If you sign up using your Gmail account, Auth0 records your Email address only, and none of your health information is shared with Google. Your Gmail address is only used so you can login and not have to remember a separate password for the Thrive platform. The Thrive platform does not have access to your Gmail password or account. This only applies if you have created a login for the Thrive platform. Eg, it does not apply to the BC or Canada COVID-19 apps.

#### [Segment](https://segment.com/) (USA)

These usage metrics allow us to better understand how our products are being used and improve our platform. The randomly generated identifier(s) are used to uniquely identify your user event data. These identifiers cannot be used to identify you, or tie this user event data back to your personal identity. Does not apply to the BC or Canada COVID-19 apps.

#### [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) (USA)
Amplitude is a solution that consumes the product usage metrics collected using Segment and allows our product team to analyze those metrics to generate insights and reports.

#### [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) (USA)
Google Analytics provides application usage metrics similar to Amplitude. IP Addresses collected by Google Analytics are automatically masked to preserve anonymity.

#### [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) (Canada)
