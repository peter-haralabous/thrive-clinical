# MAIN CODE 1: WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY & TIME MANAGEMENT

**Definition:** This main code captures all aspects of time spent on administrative tasks, preparation activities, workflow inefficiencies, and systemic barriers that detract from direct patient care. It includes both the actual time burden and the impact on provider capacity and job satisfaction.

**When to use:** Apply when providers discuss time spent on tasks, workflow bottlenecks, efficiency challenges, administrative burden, or system-level process inefficiencies.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for discussions about clinical decision-making time, patient interaction time, or time spent on actual care delivery (unless explicitly framed as burdensome).

---

## SUBCODE 1.1: Pre-Visit Data Review Time

**Definition:** Time providers spend reviewing patient information, medical history, test results, and other documentation before seeing a patient. Includes variability based on case complexity.

**When to use:** When providers describe preparing for appointments, reviewing charts, reading through documents, or gathering information before patient encounters.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for time spent during the visit or for post-visit documentation time.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (VW - PR08):**
> "Um, and I have a look at their medications because it helps kind of frame my differential of what could be going on with them. Um, so I usually look at their whatever it says on the computer for their past medical history and their medications first. um and the triage note and their vital signs and then I'll go into the room most part less than five minutes a couple of minutes if it's a very complicated patient... they're a cancer patient and I want to see oh what have they had so far for their cancer treatment then I'm pulling up old notes like the the chemo notes the radiation notes and I'm kind of like reading through the the surgery three notes from their cancer. I'm kind of like skimming those notes a little bit. Um, so that one maybe 10 10 minutes."

**Quote 2 (MB - PR15):**
> "the nurse will spend an hour or so on that I will have the encounter time which will be 30 to 40 minutes with the patient plus I might do 20 minutes of prep. So I could easily round that up to an hour."

**Quote 3 (JB - PR29):**
> "you know a lot of us um you know when we talk about the pre-mission clinic um that's not a favorite position for anesthesiologists right and uh you know I I I enjoy the pre-mission clinic but I wouldn't want to do that every single day because there's a lot of stress to get through 12 patients in a short period of time. And again, I I don't know how, you know, people have decided that they will just the night before look through quickly the patient list for the following day, but you end up spending a lot of time doing that."

**Quote 4 (JG - PR13):**
> "pre pre um prescribed berry I probably spent sometimes it's 10 to 15 minutes for a complex case um if it's here in the hospital and patients are like yeah it can be as long as like half an hour sometimes, right? That's probably the like the the extreme end of like clicking on Cerner and clicking on Care Connect, opening, closing, opening, closing, opening, closing. Um, writing down important information."

**Quote 5 (AA - PR30):**
> "I've already reviewed their labs and I actually turn that visit that could if I if if I'm not organized and not well informed, it could be 25 minutes visit. I can actually get it done probably in seven minutes. Believe it or not, in my in my emergency medicine uh practice, uh I don't take notes in front of patients ever... I I I actually gather as much information before seeing patients, right? And I do much of my documentation on my way to seeing the patient"

**Quote 6 (RA - PR26):**
> "So there is some prep to get all that done because a follow-up visit is typically 10 or 15 minutes. It's often on the phone. and you have to in that time get the history, sort out what they've done, go through the results, formulate a plan, send them prescriptions or new investigations, and dictate a report all in about 10 or 15 minutes."

---

## SUBCODE 1.2: Manual Data Entry Burden

**Definition:** Time and effort spent manually entering, transferring, or duplicating patient information across systems or forms. Includes typing, copying-pasting, and redundant documentation.

**When to use:** When providers describe typing information, manually entering data, copying between systems, or creating documentation from scratch.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for automated data entry or for reviewing already-entered data.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (LT - PR23):**
> "Yeah, there's a lot of faxing. There's a lot of repeated work. There's a lot of printing things out and writing on it. And then there's a lot of duplication of effort putting it into the electronic health record."

**Quote 2 (RA - PR26):**
> "So one of the not the medical stuff but more from our staff is there's a profile in the EMR for every patient. It includes number, their address, which is constantly changing, their email, all that. So that has to be manually entered since sometimes there's errors in that manual entry."

**Quote 3 (MB - PR15):**
> "That's the one where I would love more support because that's just busy work right... Totally. Totally. It's poor it's poor use of of my um and the nursing team's skill set really."

**Quote 4 (MB - PR15):**
> "So I could easily round that up to an hour. So there's another there's a couple of hours which some is patient facing some is just doing a little bit of sleuth work getting prepared and then building out the chart."

**Quote 5 (LT - PR23):**
> "And I think probably having succinct summary information, right, Lindy? So that every person that touches the patient doesn't have to read through their whole screener questions."

**Quote 6 (RA - PR26):**
> "They would mail it back to you. You would sign your letter and you would mail it to the family doctor. And then eventually we went to digital services and now it's just all voice transcription. So my letter is ready 10 minutes after the patient has left the room."

---

## SUBCODE 1.3: Wait List and Triage Management

**Definition:** Challenges related to managing patient wait lists, prioritizing referrals, and triaging patients efficiently. Includes the inability to interact with or prepare patients during long wait times.

**When to use:** When providers discuss wait lists, referral backlogs, patient prioritization, or opportunities to engage patients while waiting.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for scheduling issues unrelated to wait times or for discussions about appointment booking systems.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JH - PR06):**
> "I would I would hope that you would get an understanding of people's weight lists. Um like how how long are those weight lists? How many patients are those weight lists across all the physicians you're interviewing? So you'll get a you'll get a sense of scope of the problem. um because those are really the people that you we can help and interact with and help the physician and the patient um by getting in the middle of that loop."

**Quote 2 (JH - PR06):**
> "Um, and so I think most would say if you can take information from my patients, triage them into a priority bucket and I review kind of two ends of that bucket. One end is the super urgent. I'll make sure they really are. Um, and I may need to order some tests before they come and see me because I'm sure we've all been to see a doctor where you wait, you wait, you wait, you go in, and then they go, 'Oh, I need an ultrasound, an ECG, and a this before I can answer this question.' You're like, 'I literally just waited nine months, and now I have to go get all these tests.'"

**Quote 3 (JH - PR06):**
> "Patients now get nothing, right? I mean, you don't even know if you're on a wait list. Someone will say, 'I've referred you to someone.' And you literally have no idea if the referral went through. it might be a year later and you get a phone call."

**Quote 4 (JB - PR18):**
> "Yeah, they can call. Yeah, they can call and inquire about and then like I think right now we're actually booking into like late October. So, I mean, I could say there's a weight, but um"

**Quote 5 (JH - PR06):**
> "even if the whole process still takes nine months, if they're doing something a little bit along the way, they they feel they're being interacted with. Um, and leaving them with I think I'm on a wait list, but I don't know. Patients hate that."

**Quote 6 (JH - PR06):**
> "Let us interview the patients. Let's let's propose to you what we think the tests are. The interesting thing is there's also a revenue opportunity in there because you cycle once in an asynchronous way with the doc who says, 'Yes, I'd like to see these tests.' They then order those tests and it all sort of happens with clicks of buttons."

## SUBCODE 1.4: Repetitive Patient Questioning

**Definition:** Time wasted asking patients the same questions across multiple providers or encounters. Includes patient frustration with repeating their history.

**When to use:** When providers or discussions mention patients having to repeat information, redundant questioning, or inefficiencies from lack of information sharing.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for necessary clarifying questions or when providers intentionally re-ask for verification purposes.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (LT - PR23):**
> "And I think probably having succinct summary information, right, Lindy? So that every person that touches the patient doesn't have to read through their whole screener questions."

**Quote 2 (CT - PR10):**
> "Yeah. So one it looks like sometimes what it'll do is rather than ask you know what medical history you have it will mention what it knows already so the patient doesn't list it have to list everything and then be like oh yeah I knew that already you know like um you know or I can't see any surgeries that you've had you know have you had surgeries or whatever um to avoid the sort of repetitive aspect of filling it out."

**Quote 3 (AW - PR19):**
> "it's almost like the the first time you need to introduce yourself as a patient, you have to go through it and retell your health history over and over again, right?"

**Quote 4 (JB - PR14):**
> "Like if you now like already see their all their whole muscular scalo history and you know their fitness level and you know their activity history and it's like wow I just saved literally the first appointment. Um that ask all those questions."

**Quote 5 (JH - PR06):**
> "making sure that when they're coming in, I know as much about them as I can. Um, and then when they leave, I know that they have the right instructions and are going to go and do the right things. And so that whole communication loop will be really important to them."

**Quote 6 (CT - PR10):**
> "you know, and sometimes you ask a few more questions and they have a bunch of other operations they didn't remember or didn't think to write down."

---

## SUBCODE 1.5: Administrative Overload & Tool Resistance

**Definition:** Provider overwhelm from constant demands to adopt new tools, complete additional administrative tasks, and maintain documentation beyond direct patient care. Includes reluctance to adopt new systems regardless of potential benefits due to existing burden.

**When to use:** When providers express feeling overwhelmed by administrative demands, resistance to new tools despite benefits, or discuss unpaid administrative work.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for specific concerns about a particular tool's features (use 3.4 instead).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (MB - PR15):**
> "there's just so much uh that we're constantly being asked to take on... the doctors when they pulled them, they said, 'Look, we know that goals of care, as an example, what you want on your deathbed is important... and even as we know it's going to make our lives better... we still are not willing to take it on.'"

**Quote 2 (MB - PR15):**
> "So they're going to Allied Health... because Allied Health is has is okay. They're not they're not pushing back the way doctors are"

**Quote 3 (VW - PR08):**
> "you don't get paid for that phone call. So, it's kind of like why like, you know, I'm I'm spending all this time explaining something, but I'm planning like if I was a specialist, I'd say like I'm I'm explaining all of this stuff to the family doctor for free"

**Quote 4 (MB - PR15):**
> "Totally. Totally. It's poor it's poor use of of my um and the nursing team's skill set really."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "I just don't know if it would be worth an implementation process for cost and now there's another portal to be a part of, there's another place to look for information, those type of things."

**Quote 6 (JH - PR06):**
> "I don't think you'll find physicians will give you the answer. That's not physicians are generally not wired to be creative in solution making to make their practice better. That's not how they were trained. They don't get a single hour of training in nine years of how should my practice function. It's all just about medicine."

## SUBCODE 1.6: Referral System Inefficiencies

**Definition:** Challenges in the referral process between primary care and specialists including communication barriers, referral rejections, multiple submission requirements, and limited direct provider-to-provider communication.

**When to use:** When providers discuss referral process problems, waitlist rejections, inability to communicate between referring and receiving providers, or inefficiencies in the referral workflow.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for wait list issues unrelated to referrals (use 1.3) or for general communication gaps (use 4.1).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (VW - PR08):**
> "the family doctor has to send like four or five referrals until one gets accepted by a specialist... You don't you wait until they the specialist will fax you back saying rejected... My weight list is too long. I can't where I don't see that particular subsp specialty part of of this."

**Quote 2 (VW - PR08):**
> "family doctors can't really call a specialist um to get a same day answer. Um that really only happens in the hospital system... they can't pick up the phone and really call anyone."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR00):**
> "I don't expect my family doctors to know what's important and not important in urology. That's why I'm the specialist. And so if they send something that's not important or seems pretty trivial, obviously it was something that they did not know or did not understand."

**Quote 4 (VW - PR08):**
> "you don't get paid for that phone call. So, it's kind of like why like, you know, I'm I'm spending all this time explaining something, but I'm planning like if I was a specialist, I'd say like I'm I'm explaining all of this stuff to the family doctor for free"

**Quote 5 (MB - PR15):**
> "this is one of the biggest bug bears in medicine is um uh access to information, efficient use of medical information, communicating uh it's where a lot of mistakes happen."

---

## SUBCODE 1.7: Time Efficiency Skepticism (NEW)

**Definition:** Doubts that AI tools will produce net time savings once verification time, gap-filling questions, and learning curves are accounted for. Providers questioning whether promised efficiency gains are real.

**When to use:** When providers express skepticism about whether new tools actually save time, or discuss how verification/gap-filling may negate time savings.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general AI accuracy concerns (use 2.2) or for positive efficiency experiences.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (KM - PR21):**
> "Because to me the me reading through this will also cut into any minimal time that's saved, right?"

**Quote 2 (CT - PR10):**
> "I definitely have to read through that consult note um to make sure that It's accurate."

**Quote 3 (KM - PR21):**
> "there there might still be gaps where we still have to or areas where we still have to probe, right?"

**Quote 4 (CT - PR10):**
> "you know, and sometimes you ask a few more questions and they have a bunch of other operations they didn't remember or didn't think to write down."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "And then on the other end when it's completed, what does that look like? Like what do I get as a clinician at the end?... Because to me the me reading through this will also cut into any minimal time that's saved, right?"

# MAIN CODE 2: DATA QUALITY & TRUST

**Definition:** This main code encompasses all concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and validity of patient-reported and AI-generated information. It includes verification requirements, error risks, conditional trust patterns, and challenges related to how patients understand and report medical information.

**When to use:** Apply when providers discuss trusting data, verifying information, checking accuracy, or expressing concerns about data reliability.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general data collection issues unrelated to trust/accuracy (e.g., missing data, incomplete forms).

---

## SUBCODE 2.1: Patient-Reported Data Verification

**Definition:** Providers' need to independently verify information that patients provide, including their reluctance to accept patient-reported values, diagnoses, or test results without confirmation from official sources.

**When to use:** When providers describe checking patient statements, looking up official records, or expressing skepticism about patient-supplied information.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for AI-generated data verification or for general discussion of data accuracy.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR00):**
> "So I mean I I wouldn't I don't accept any data from the patient. So if they say oh yeah my PSA last year was two um I'll write it down that okay you know patients reported PSA of two but I will follow up on that and get the information myself to confirm it. Uh, so I don't trust the patient for the direct data, but if they said they had a PSA done last year, then I will take that information and search it out, right?"

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR00):**
> "Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. I mean, if they on history say, 'I have diabetes.' Yeah, I take that for face value that they have diabetes. They've been told they have diabetes. Um, you know, more often than not, patients will know their disease entities quite well, what they have. Uh, however, um, also depends on how you phrase the question. Like the number of times where I'll go, 'Do you have high blood pressure?' And they'll go, 'No.' And then I look at their meds and they're on anti-hypertensive and I'm like, 'Oh, but you're taking this medication for your blood pressure.' And they're like, 'Yeah.' So, my blood pressure is not high anymore, right?"

**Quote 3 (JH - PR06):**
> "Yeah, I I think if the patient has written it versus said it, I don't think the doctor will trust it more or less. Patients lie a lot. Um, and so I think physicians are always a bit suspicious of what patients say. Um uh you know when we ask people about alcohol and drug use, most physicians will have some factor that they apply to it. You know, if someone tells you that they drink two drinks a week, they probably actually drink six. Like it's just patients lie. Um and and it's pretty normal. So I don't think you'd run into that trust problem um any more than you run into it in person."

**Quote 4 (AW - PR19):**
> "Yeah. Because like a patient might not even understand their diagnosis. They might put in, you know, if they have numbness in their legs, we know that's because they have a ridiculopathy in their back. They have pinched nerve in their back. So we would put it in our thing as this is um you know like a ridiculopathy. the patient would put it in as pain in the legs, which is like two different things that you would then go down a very different path for."

**Quote 5 (AW - PR19):**
> "So, I guess that's what I'm trying to say is it's it's really important to make sure that information is truth when it's going in. If the patient is going to be the source of truth, it's truth or twice, but now"

**Quote 6 (JB - PR18):**
> "The user does add their record, are you still checking Care Connect? You still checking labs if they've added it? Okay. Well, it's that trust issue."

---

## SUBCODE 2.2: AI-Generated Content Verification

**Definition:** Concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated summaries, notes, or data extractions, including the need to review and verify AI output before clinical use.

**When to use:** When providers discuss checking AI output, finding errors in AI-generated content, or expressing need to review AI work.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general AI adoption challenges unrelated to accuracy concerns.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (VW - PR08):**
> "Yeah, I see what you mean. Um, yeah, I think that that that would be maybe a bit tricky. I feel like I would want to double check like if a patient's information was summarized by AI, I'd want to double check that it was right for the most part. Um, yeah."

**Quote 2 (CT - PR10):**
> "It definitely needs to be checked though... I definitely have to read through that consult note um to make sure that It's accurate."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR01):**
> "Um so one of the challenges that I run into right now is that um you have to stay on top of reading it because it's not fail safe and there's you know information that's that the AI will um will will present that might not be quite correct or it's interpreted it slightly in a different way."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR01):**
> "and then the other challenge I think is is you you start to develop a bit of complacency as a physician because you assume the AI has captured everything and it's presented it correctly and you don't read through the note as carefully and things can get missed, right?"

**Quote 5 (LT - PR11):**
> "I don't think it knows enough... Like I don't I don't think it's it's precise enough yet... I don't love the idea of of setting it free without doing like some really careful thought experiments."

**Quote 6 (JG - PR13):**
> "That's changed. That should fall off the list. Sometimes it gets it wrong. Like 5% of the time it gets it wrong when I just sort of record like my stream of consciousness as I'm collecting data and talking to a patient and I have to catch that on on the back end."

---

## SUBCODE 2.3: Clinical Accountability and Error Prevention

**Definition:** Providers' responsibility to ensure data accuracy to prevent clinical errors, including past experiences with documentation errors and the consequences of using incorrect information.

**When to use:** When providers discuss being caught with errors, liability concerns, or the clinical impact of inaccurate information.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general quality improvement discussions unrelated to specific error prevention.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "And I think that's very important. I mean I've been caught off a couple of times where back in the day when I used to use macros to complete my templates to make it faster. So I always ask the same questions and then I would type in a macro which would just give me that information out. and occasionally I missed things that the patient I didn't ask the patient but it was in the macro and so I got a couple times I got caught out once with the patient who had requested a copy of their report from their family doctor and then they came back to me with highlights in yellow saying we didn't talk about this and I said this about this"

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "So I guess it's good in the sense that it makes the physician more accountable for the information but also we have to be aware that there are sometimes things that we omit purposefully because they have no clinical relevance or where the patient thinks it's very relevant but we realize that it has no bearing on their disease process."

**Quote 3 (AW - PR19):**
> "So for the example we were talking about the new patient, your premise is the patient would come with this and that would kind of be all of their information. But I I think what I'm saying from a clinician perspective is I'd be very nervous about just taking that stuff at face value in case there's errors or right that you like it you have to be so careful that the information you're working off is the correct information. So that's why holding it with the patient as there has to be a mechanism for it to be validated going in there."

**Quote 4 (JB - PR18):**
> "Well unless... Well, I think you'd build well two things. one, you'd build in some disclaimer or consent form on the person being like you need to verify that your information is true, otherwise like your care could be adversely affected, which is also why you have to have the export step of like if I view information on this platform, I need to export it import into mine. So like there there's evidence of what I looked at."

**Quote 5 (VW - PR08):**
> "Um in the hospitals we have like a a dictaphone where it transcribes for you and I feel that Heidi would actually be more reliable than the dictapones because there's a lot of errors with those and um you're going you're moving so fast and you're so busy that I don't always pro like I don't proofread every sentence and things like that. So I know that there are errors in my notes."

## SUBCODE 2.4: Source Attribution and Traceability

**Definition:** The need to trace data back to its original source for verification, including linking summaries to source documents, knowing when information was collected, and being able to audit where information came from.

**When to use:** When providers discuss wanting to see source documents, checking citations, temporal context of data, or needing to trace back to original data.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general data provenance discussions unrelated to verification needs.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JB - PR18):**
> "basically everything is almost annotated where you could like either hover over it, right click on it or something and you can say like where did this come from and it will link you to like the initial PDF... clinicians will really really want that or they'll want to know like yeah was this self-reported on an intake Q&A or was this like from a refer Yeah. from a referral letter"

**Quote 2 (JB - PR18):**
> "you could import a referral letter from like six years ago and it might say like oh they're on this medication and obviously you know that medication may have started stopped and whatnot."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR00):**
> "the only other thing you'd need to know is the timeline. Like, was this test done yesterday or was it done 10 years ago? Obviously, right?"

**Quote 4 (VW - PR08):**
> "People for the majority like it um when I use open evidence like I I do feel reassured that it it cites its sources at the bottom which obviously this would be different because it's patient information so you can't like kind of check a source and things like that"

**Quote 5 (HG - PR28):**
> "most of us will trust up to date because it's um it's put together by people. Uh they they probably do use some AI, but it at least you've got the name of the person that wrote the article on what to do."

---

## SUBCODE 2.5: Patient Digital Literacy and Understanding

**Definition:** Concerns about patients' ability to use digital tools, understand medical terminology, and accurately report their medical information through technology interfaces.

**When to use:** When providers discuss patient ability to use technology, understanding of medical terms, or challenges with patient comprehension.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for language translation needs (use 9.3) or general patient engagement.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR01):**
> "So, I'm just thinking about people who may not be as literate, right? To have that information or to be able to respond with a voice back and forth, have the option to do that would be nice."

**Quote 2 (CT - PR10):**
> "I guess um and then can patients like I guess the other question is can they do it verbally or does it have to do they have to type? Um yeah like I think I I'm guessing most people be comfortable with doing this but yeah I guess if they're typing it already then this is probably easier."

**Quote 3 (JB - PR14):**
> "But then we do get the occasional person who's like typically a bit older and cognitively not all there where we actually they may or may not fill out the questionnaire and we have to like do everything by call"

**Quote 4 (AW - PR19):**
> "Yeah. Because like a patient might not even understand their diagnosis. They might put in, you know, if they have numbness in their legs, we know that's because they have a ridiculopathy in their back. They have pinched nerve in their back. So we would put it in our thing as this is um you know like a ridiculopathy. the patient would put it in as pain in the legs, which is like two different things that you would then go down a very different path for."

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR00):**
> "Um, you know, more often than not, patients will know their disease entities quite well, what they have. Uh, however, um, also depends on how you phrase the question. Like the number of times where I'll go, 'Do you have high blood pressure?' And they'll go, 'No.' And then I look at their meds and they're on anti-hypertensive"

## SUBCODE 2.6: Conditional Trust Patterns (NEW)

**Definition:** Nuanced approach to data reliability where providers trust positive findings but don't trust absence of data. Asymmetric trust: believing something is present if reported, but not assuming absence means it doesn't exist.

**When to use:** When providers describe trusting presence of information but not absence, or nuanced conditional approaches to data trust.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general skepticism (use 2.1) or complete trust/distrust of data sources.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR00):**
> "if there is pertinent positive information in Care Connect and it's fed to me as a urologist or as whatever that's useful. Yes, I would use that. Okay. However, if it was absent, I wouldn't rely upon that being the truth... if it's fed to me and it's there, then I consider that the truth. Um but if it's not there, I don't assume it not to be there, right?"

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR00):**
> "Uh, so I don't trust the patient for the direct data, but if they said they had a PSA done last year, then I will take that information and search it out, right?"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR00):**
> "Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. I mean, if they on history say, 'I have diabetes.' Yeah, I take that for face value that they have diabetes."

**Quote 4 (JH - PR06):**
> "Yeah, I I think if the patient has written it versus said it, I don't think the doctor will trust it more or less. Patients lie a lot... So I don't think you'd run into that trust problem um any more than you run into it in person."

**Quote 5 (AW - PR19):**
> "So, I guess that's what I'm trying to say is it's it's really important to make sure that information is truth when it's going in."

# MAIN CODE 3: TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION & ADOPTION

**Definition:** This main code covers all aspects of implementing and adopting new technologies in clinical practice, including AI scribes, conversational intake tools, voice interfaces, and learning systems. It encompasses technical challenges, integration barriers, multi-tool ecosystem management, and provider customization needs.

**When to use:** Apply when providers discuss trying new tools, implementation challenges, technical issues, or technology learning and adaptation.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general IT support issues or hardware problems.

---

## SUBCODE 3.1: AI Scribe Adoption and Usage

**Definition:** Providers' experiences with AI scribing tools (like Heidi, Empathia, BC Scribe) including benefits, limitations, workflow integration, and accuracy of transcription/summarization.

**When to use:** When providers discuss using AI scribes, dictation tools, or automated documentation systems.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for manual dictation or traditional transcription services.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (HG - PR28):**
> "So actually since we met a few things have happened on both those fronts. Um so on the AI scribe you know we've got the BC scribe project going now. Um and a number of us in our in my group have tried the AI scribes and um yeah that it's going very well. I think quite a few people are going to adopt those... Oh, well, it's it's amazing. You ceue up the AI scribe at the beginning of the appointment and you just talk to the patient. Um, and then at the end it generates a transcript that you edit. Um, there isn't yet a direct link into our EMR, so we have to copy and paste it, but that is not hard."

**Quote 2 (CT - PR10):**
> "I'm using Empathia... two other people in my office are using uh Heidi... before I see a patient, my MOA sets up an encounter, um, uploads the referral letter, um, and then also uploads like any other stuff that's come along with that, like investigations, but then also the PDF that the Thrive uh, produces"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "Yeah, there is. So I mean again Heidi is more I guess transription transference of that transcription right. summarizing our conversation and then presenting the pertinent information whereas the chat is actually performing the questioning and then summarizing it... Absolutely because I would continue using Heidi because I'm going to get the rest of the history. and I love using Heidi for that because I don't have to actually sit there and take notes. I just talk."

**Quote 4 (RA - PR26):**
> "And then eventually we went to digital services and now it's just all voice transcription. So my letter is ready 10 minutes after the patient has left the room. So the cost used to be much higher when you had typus it I mean with it the costs have come down substantially but it typically used to cost me about $10 for each consultation. And now if I'm paying $30 a month for, hundreds of consultations, we're looking at, a less than a dollar per per consult letter."

**Quote 5 (JG - PR13):**
> "It's been faster with Scribe than it had been before. Um, so I can just auto talk about the labs as they come in. I don't have to like manually pick them. So my time spent, my average time spent is probably sub five minutes now. Um because I can kind of just like with my eyes and my mouse do it at the same time."

**Quote 6 (HG - PR28):**
> "There are six AI scribes that are being triled. And so, some of my colleagues are on the second or third one. Each trial is six weeks. Um, and then, you know, so yeah, so that's well underway. Um and I would say you know the the feedback and everything has been overwhelmingly positive."

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "for me to have access to outpatient reports and imaging. I actually so I mean they were very generous and I during my time working with them I actually arranged for our group members to have access to their archive but I have to actually separately log into every single one of their paxes right and sometimes they're like okay I had an X-ray where was it was in Kokla well there's three of them in Kokla it was I think it was somewhere down close to Poco and then you go and looked that up and there's nothing there oh you know what actually it was in New West Okay. Well, it was Brookke radiology. So, so you know that takes like 17 minutes of my time, right?"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "I often will upload imaging results, laboratory investigations, past medical history that the family doctor has sent me in a form of a PDF. I'll just copy and paste that information into Heidi"

**Quote 4 (MB - PR15):**
> "So like the way the chart works, you have all of your encounter notes, right? And those are just you just scroll down to read your encounter notes and then you have your document section, your results section. And what I would like is what is best is if the information you need is all readily available in your problem list... if it's coming in in a scannable document, those where does that go, right? That goes into old records uh, in your document section of your EMR and it'll be filed by date."

**Quote 5 (AA - PR30):**
> "Well, so I can see I can see certain practices that can actually use this, but the reality is that pretty much any EMR commercially available EMR out there does this to some extent at certain level of performance."

**Quote 3 (CT - PR10):**
> "Yeah. So one it looks like sometimes what it'll do is rather than ask you know what medical history you have it will mention what it knows already so the patient doesn't list it have to list everything and then be like oh yeah I knew that already you know like um you know or I can't see any surgeries that you've had you know have you had surgeries or whatever um to avoid the sort of repetitive aspect of filling it out."

**Quote 4 (JB - PR14):**
> "Yeah, I guess the question would be like exactly what's the interaction because like for us, let's say intake call, they've done the Q&A, so we're reviewing the like the Q&A and so we kind of know what questions to prompt."

**Quote 5 (LT - PR11):**
> "I I wonder I don't know the answer to this, but is this easier for a patient to fill out than a form or not?"

---

## SUBCODE 3.4: Change Management and Adoption Resistance

**Definition:** Concerns about implementing new systems including learning curves, adding "another portal," disrupting established workflows, and resistance to changing current processes.

**When to use:** When providers express hesitation about adoption, concerns about disruption, or questions about whether new tools are worth the effort.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (KM - PR21):**
> "I just don't know if it would be worth an implementation process for cost and now there's another portal to be a part of, there's another place to look for information, those type of things. Um, again, I I can see where where it's nice and consolidates everything. Yeah, I I think for me personally, I I just don't see where I feel that I would need to implement it versus just the verbal."

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "Well, so I can see I can see certain practices that can actually use this, but the reality is that pretty much any EMR commercially available EMR out there does this to some extent at certain level of performance. Right? So yeah,"

**Quote 3 (JB - PR14):**
> "Um, so I'd say like what's, you know, what's this, like why would someone buy this? Like what's the price point? Why would someone buy this is I guess not, you guys obviously thought about it, but kind of what I would come back to"

**Quote 4 (MB - PR15):**
> "Um uh okay. So then thinking about it from a family doctor's perspective on the Northshore, thinking about that family doctor in private practice who's right now, like I say, they're all, not all, but many of the many of them are trying out AI now. And so here's my question to you, like is are the AI and I don't know if you know the answer, but are the AIs that are out there right now that they might be trying, can they do any of this?"

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "No, no, no. Totally fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'm still waiting for the surprises."

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "So, something that's kind of interesting that I played around with and kind of have a little bit of a working template around which may or may not be kind of relevant to what you've built out here is I started to tap on the new natural language in chat GPT and what I did was I took 10 interviews that I did with patients removed the patient demog graphics and I uploaded the voice files to chat. and I asked it to sort of learn from that and I gave it some very specific parameters basically digging around kind of a review of systems."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "What would be useful is that last feedback loop... if I were to then take the corrected transcript and put it back in and say this is more correct than what you gave me, Learn from it, And then it would then modify the next time it puts out... And if you continue to do that, theoretically, you would tighten up how it puts out outputs."

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "I want the agent to learn that in meet and greet, Alli cares about these things, right? So I'm gonna put a summary of things that matter to Ally, right, for the meet and greet."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "I fed it some more second order and some tertiary order questions. So for example if you ask the patient have you had any heart disease and they say yes then you're prompted to ask further questions."

**Quote 5 (CT - PR10):**
> "So I configured a health history intake um the provider specialy is a plastic surgeon and we're asking for general overview of the patient prior to the first visit and we are specifying some questions that we always want to ask. Um, but the the conversational aid can dig deeper into any of these."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "from talking to my son who, is kind of in the space a little bit, he's like, 'Yeah, that's just the state of where things are right now with natural language, right?'... I assume that in the next five years or whatever that will improve over time too"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "it lagged a bit and that was frustrating because it didn't have the same tempo that I would have with a patient. So the biggest frustration was that sometimes it would require a prompt to continue midway through a history taking sometimes it would lag sometimes just stop doing it."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "and then the other things like I said were some of the frustrating parts is that if I corrected it and I said okay ask a second order question it would say okay I'm going to ask you a second order question now right so things like that normally as a physician you would just naturally do it"

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "but I mean the fundamentals were there but certainly it needed a lot of buffing up still."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "What would be ideally it should have a final transcript I can just copy and paste, right?"

**Quote 3 (RA - PR26):**
> "just c it's just getting your fonts so that they're consistent, but that's not a challenging thing to do."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "I often will upload imaging results, laboratory investigations, past medical history that the family doctor has sent me in a form of a PDF. I'll just copy and paste that information into Heidi"

**Quote 5 (HG - PR28):**

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "So the plan would be to copy that into probably the output that I would request is basically a transcribed version of that conversation. so for example I use Heidi right now for transcription."

**Quote 3 (KM - PR21):**
> "if they're booking online, we follow or use the Jane app software. So, for the most part, if they're creating their own profile, they're finding their own appointment, they're prompted through Jane to fill out our intake form... So we are very much a Jane uh facilitated clinic"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "I often will upload imaging results, laboratory investigations, past medical history that the family doctor has sent me in a form of a PDF. I'll just copy and paste that information into Heidi"

**Quote 5 (JB - PR18):**
> "I'd want to just get all my PDFs in there and that's where my PDFs will live like my copy of them will live on this platform"

> "it was really cool to toy around with it and that the natural language selection was just kind of cool way to integrate that into my history taking."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "and then I had chat kind of listen in on a couple of pseudo conversations with patients as and learn with the tempo and how because it was kind of going a bit slow when I first tried it out... I also kind of had it, I said, 'Look, listen to my tone and intonation. I tend to be more relaxed.'"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "Yeah. I mean, they were quite intrigued, right? So, my practice patients were family, friends, and other physicians and nurses. but everyone was just in awe over it. It was kind of cool and it sounded very realistic because it's natural language"

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "I fed it some more second order and some tertiary order questions. So for example if you ask the patient have you had any heart disease and they say yes then you're prompted to ask further questions... in certain areas I asked it to go deeper with second order questions"

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (AA - PR30):**
> "I think that to to make things intuitive is to to use eye movement and what I can actually gather in terms of data as much as possible without using other things... if we have already sent a form but the form has not been filled and sent back I was going to actually say that right that's also another information that if it's given to me before I click on a tab I appreciate it because I'm not so that saves me one click"

**Quote 2 (RA - PR26):**
> "it would have been nice if you could have a patient intake form, take the past medical history and at least start to populate some of those fields so that you could make it even more of a list form. I often just dictate, patient has a history of hypertension, gastric reflex, blah blah. It' be nice if it was just done in point forms. it's easier to read in that way."

**Quote 3 (JH - PR06):**
> "I'd almost organize my top left there by tasks that are patient focused versus summary templates, form templates, recommendation templates. Because when you go through your day, you're you're sort of doing like new patients, old patients, you know, you know, people bouncing back, uh, test results, like those are those are sort of the tasks that you have in your day that are related to your patients"

**Quote 4 (JB - PR14):**
> "So, what I would see like I won't show my EMR right now, but I can show that offline later. Um, like I would love to see basically like a dash. Yeah. a dashboard that kind of gives me the key information I need to know and then kind of allows me to click into things to get more information as I need to."

**When to use:** When providers discuss transferring patients, referral communication, or information gaps between providers.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for communication issues within a single care team or for referral process inefficiencies (use 1.6).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (LT - PR23):**
> "Uh it's going to be primarily related to the multiple handovers between care providers. So it has to touch a lot of people... And I think probably having succinct summary information, right, Lindy? So that every person that touches the patient doesn't have to read through their whole screener questions."

**Quote 2 (LT - PR23):**
> "Yeah, there's a lot of faxing. There's a lot of repeated work. There's a lot of printing things out and writing on it. And then there's a lot of duplication of effort putting it into the electronic health record."

**Quote 3 (RM - PR23):**
> "It's pretty much like surgeon, pack nurse, booking clerks, booking nurse, anesthesiologist. Who am I missing? I think those are the main ones."

**Quote 4 (AA - PR30):**
> "Obviously, we don't have access to their family doctor's office. We don't know what what their rheatologist told them last time because these are all in private offices, right? But they're very complex and they they end up in hospital every six weeks, right? Every time they come to hospital, it goes by their memory or their son-in-law who took them there and they're not here today."

**Quote 5 (MB - PR15):**
> "this is one of the biggest bug bears in medicine is um uh access to information, efficient use of medical information, communicating uh it's where a lot of mistakes happen."

---

## SUBCODE 4.2: Aggregating Multi-Source Data

**Definition:** Technical and practical challenges of pulling together patient information from various systems (labs, imaging, specialists, primary care) into a single comprehensive view.

**When to use:** When providers discuss combining data from multiple sources, searching across systems, or creating unified patient profiles.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for single data source issues.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JB - PR18):**
> "I feel like the optimal area to start with is just like helping people get it all in one place. That's it."

**Quote 2 (JB - PR29):**
> "You could imagine if you had like a centralized portal for that patient like one patient record instead of like having all the same information or...updating the same information in multiple different systems"

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "The one thing that this is trying to do that EMRs don't do is take advantage of that network effect of the compound data that that that patient is getting because of all the touch points in their lives. It might start off slow but as that network grows there are more people contributing you know indirectly or directly uh to that health person's record which is growing and growing growing because it's essentially one record that's shared amongst all touch points."

**Quote 4 (RA - PR26):**
> "And yes, yeah, exactly. that's the idea is once we've got a patient now we can continue to add data over time when the new stuff comes in and just dump it in let AI look at it say hey this is what I think it is I'm going to apply it to the patient and you can see that if this continues to happen from one clinic to another clinic different specialists that profile starts getting bigger and bigger and bigger about that patient."

**Quote 5 (JB - PR14):**
> "So my goal actually is like for the physician who's seen them on the first day, I basically don't want them to have to look anywhere else beyond just their chart. Like every piece of information they need automatically pulls in or it's kind of in their dashboard. They don't have to go searching."

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for provider-controlled records or traditional EMR discussions.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JB - PR14):**
> "So we're not trying to replace all the EMRs. We're just trying to give the information a home to live in. While it's there, we're trying to make it more effectively digested by both the end user and the clinician... So it's it's basically trying to be that bridge between clinician and their EMR and person."

**Quote 2 (JB - PR18):**
> "all my notes are the patients right. So if I've written my notes and they request a copy of it, they get a copy of it... if everybody was using the system and everybody was pulling data from their different sources and that's always being compiled and consolidated and built in this knowledge graph on that patient, then that goes everywhere that patient goes."

**Quote 3 (MB - PR15):**
> "if she had that where it was already done and ready and she could provide that information directly to her new doctor and take that everywhere she goes, that's fantastic. I think that goes a long way."

**Quote 4 (RA - PR26):**
> "So you're not only just dealing with your own cases in your interaction with that patient but all the other touch points that patient has gone through. That's the vision anyways. So that we start building this set of data on that follows the patient around that no matter what care touch point that they interact with you will get access to that data with their consent of course."

**Quote 5 (AA - PR30):**
> "imagine imagine I mean this is imagine an RF model, right? where either I don't know Bluetooth RF or some level of actually data transfer that patients can actually give that this information to providers right with without limitation like in uh so agnostic to agnostic to which center you're at or what EMR they're using right patients can actually provide this information"

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (AA - PR30):**
> "for me to have access to outpatient reports and imaging. I actually so I mean they were very generous and I during my time working with them I actually arranged for our group members to have access to their archive but I have to actually separately log into every single one of their paxes right and sometimes they're like okay I had an X-ray where was it was in Kokla well there's three of them in Kokla it was I think it was somewhere down close to Poco and then you go and looked that up and there's nothing there oh you know what actually it was in New West Okay. Well, it was Brookke radiology. So, so you know that takes like 17 minutes of my time, right?"

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "Obviously, we don't have access to their family doctor's office. We don't know what what their rheatologist told them last time because these are all in private offices, right?"

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "For example, community radiology, right? Community radiology is not connected to anything really, right?"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR01):**
> "when you do get called out or when you do see someone in merge, uh gaining access to all of their data can be a real challenge um on an emergency setting. So I have quick access to uh let's say the what's available on Cerner... Um but let's say the patient has traveled. So this is very commonly happens to me."

**Quote 5 (RA - PR26):**
> "would it access hospital systems? I mean that's another step. I mean ultimately because even I've lived through the development of we're with Cerner now through at St. calls and over time when people go to all these different as you call them touch points and more and more information gets in there to create a consult now is literally moments it takes because everything populates"

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general cross-system access issues affecting all providers (use 4.4).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (KM - PR21):**
> "I don't need the full health history. I just literally need access to this singular image, which EMRs in the hospitals are right already docs can just log into that EMR and pull that report out. If I could just have that ability, like from a very from allied health standpoint, I think if we could just get access to imaging reports, that would make us a lot happier."

**Quote 2 (JB - PR18):**
> "I'd want to just get all my PDFs in there and that's where my PDFs will live like my copy of them will live on this platform"

**Quote 3 (JB - PR18):**
> "they are charting like they're almost certainly using Jane. So they're charting in Jane, you just get a copy of their chart or potentially they write a summary consult or a summary note and that is what you import into your chart"

**Quote 4 (KM - PR21):**
> "for a physician, they can get paid for referring for an X-ray for example, right? There's a billing code for that. We only have billing codes for actual direct 101 care."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**

# MAIN CODE 5: CUSTOMIZATION & FLEXIBILITY

**Definition:** This main code highlights the need for adaptable tools that accommodate different specialties, practice types, and individual provider preferences. It emphasizes that healthcare is not uniform and solutions must be configurable to diverse needs including practice model variations.

**When to use:** Apply when providers discuss specialty-specific needs, custom templates, configurable workflows, practice type differences, or rejection of one-size-fits-all solutions.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general feature requests unrelated to customization or flexibility.

---

## SUBCODE 5.1: Template Customization Needs

**Definition:** Desire for configurable summary templates, note formats, and output structures that can be adapted to individual provider or specialty preferences.

**When to use:** When providers discuss wanting custom templates, different summary formats, or configurable output structures.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general formatting complaints or static template issues.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JH - PR06):**
> "and and the and ones that I would have there would be like a simple summary, an everything summary, um a a consultation request summary, um and uh and probably like a transfer summary."

**Quote 2 (JB - PR14):**
> "Yeah, like yeah, this obviously becomes more useful. Um, and I think something that you're highlighting is that actually what this exactly looks like changes depending on the user, right? Like... and the template configuration that you said like you might want this organized in a different way or prioritize certain things up top or formatted in a different way that's completely into your control."

**Quote 3 (Peter - PR06):**
> "So the summary uh feature I'm going to show you is is standalone right now but it be something that would be part of you know the conversation traditional forms or even just manual uh uh creation on the fly. And the idea behind here is that you could create your summary templates into whatever you like. You know, think of the different types of u artifacts, notes that do physicians have soap notes like a physio node like chronic pain."

**Quote 4 (AA - PR30):**
> "I actually want better than intake form, right? I want I want I want your AI AI agent to summarize it and give me the the the important stuff, right?"

**Quote 5 (JB - PR14):**
> "So, what I would see like I won't show my EMR right now, but I can show that offline later. Um, like I would love to see basically like a dash. Yeah. a dashboard that kind of gives me the key information I need to know and then kind of allows me to click into things to get more information as I need to."

---

## SUBCODE 5.2: Specialty-Specific Information Requirements

**Definition:** Different medical specialties require different types of information, levels of detail, and organizational structures. What's relevant for one specialty may be unnecessary for another.

**When to use:** When providers discuss specialty-specific data needs, different information priorities, or varying levels of detail required.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general information requests not tied to specialty differences.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (KM - PR21):**
> "I don't need the full health history. I just literally need access to this singular image, which EMRs in the hospitals are right already docs can just log into that EMR and pull that report out. If I could just have that ability, like from a very from allied health standpoint, I think if we could just get access to imaging reports, that would make us a lot happier."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR00):**
> "an orthopedic surgeon might want to know only about whether this person has a bleeding or clotting problem right uh but a cardiologist is going to want to know something very different"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR00):**
> "I mean, you could easily give the the the physician the the ability to say these are the important things that I want summarized for me, right? Checkbox, check box check, check box... if all of the pertinent PSAs uh renal function uh uralyses with you know blood in the urine and you know urine cultures for example we're all presented in a summary... I already am way ahead because I don't have to ask those questions now."

**Quote 4 (VW - PR08):**
> "there's a lot of different questions or priorities that they'd want to know"

**Quote 5 (JB - PR18):**
> "So it's it's like yeah 15 20 pages and then we you know we've tried to come up with a pretty smart way to to outline it where it's like you know we break it down by system. So actually like you know let's say the cardiovascular section you get your heart rate and blood pressure which are your vitals. You get your like physical exam findings from the doctor. You'll get ultrasound results. Then you get like your cardiovascular blood work. So like kind of all the things that kind of sensibly go together, we'd put one."

---

## SUBCODE 5.3: Configurable Question Sets

**Definition:** Ability to specify which questions are asked, at what depth, and with what follow-up logic. Includes mandatory questions vs. optional exploration.

**When to use:** When providers discuss configuring intake questions, specifying required fields, or customizing conversation flow.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for fixed questionnaires or non-configurable forms.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (CT - PR10):**
> "So I configured a health history intake um the provider specialy is a plastic surgeon and we're asking for general overview of the patient prior to the first visit and we are specifying some questions that we always want to ask. Um, but the the conversational aid can dig deeper into any of these."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "what I did is I went through and I had it go because I have a very specific manner in which I approach the review of systems and then I also fed it some more second order and some tertiary order questions. So for example if you ask the patient have you had any heart disease and they say yes then you're prompted to ask further questions."

**Quote 3 (Peter - PR06):**
> "So in our new tooling essentially we have these conversation templates where the care provider can uh basically specify what they're interested in. Um, so there might be some standard templates that you might have for follow-ups or you know first new patient or any like previsit for any general appointments. You can basically say um set that up as a care provider... And there might be some questions that you absolutely have to know. And it could be something like I I I need to know family history and it'll make sure that it covers these these questions in the conversation."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "in certain areas I asked it to go deeper with second order questions in certain areas like the past psychiatric history I wasn't that keen on knowing that much information on the patient so I had it say look limit your questioning around the past psychiatric to one minute at the most"

**Quote 5 (LT - PR11):**
> "Like I don't ask all these questions to a patient. I take a whole bunch of information and then like go down paths, right?... You can decipher what conditions they have based on their meds or ask for follow-up information based on the prefilled stuff."

## SUBCODE 5.4: Information Hierarchy and Priority

**Definition:** Providers need different information presented first/prominently based on their role and the clinical context. Summary structure should reflect provider priorities.

**When to use:** When providers discuss what information they look at first, what's most important to see, or how information should be organized.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general layout complaints unrelated to clinical priorities.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JH - PR06):**
> "I'd almost organize my top left there by tasks that are patient focused versus summary templates, form templates, recommendation templates. Because when you go through your day, you're you're sort of doing like new patients, old patients, you know, you know, people bouncing back, uh, test results, like those are those are sort of the tasks that you have in your day that are related to your patients versus, oh, I want to create a template, then find a patient. You kind of want everything to flow from the patient."

**Quote 2 (VW - PR08):**
> "Um, and I have a look at their medications because it helps kind of frame my differential of what could be going on with them. Um, so I usually look at their whatever it says on the computer for their past medical history and their medications first. um and the triage note and their vital signs and then I'll go into the room"

**Quote 3 (MB - PR15):**
> "So like the way the chart works, you have all of your encounter notes, right? And those are just you just scroll down to read your encounter notes and then you have your document section, your results section. And what I would like is what is best is if the information you need is all readily available in your problem list."

**Quote 4 (AA - PR30):**
> "I want the agent to learn that in meet and greet, Alli cares about these things, right? So I'm gonna put a summary of things that matter to Ally, right, for the meet and greet."

**Quote 5 (JB - PR14):**
> "So my goal actually is like for the physician who's seen them on the first day, I basically don't want them to have to look anywhere else beyond just their chart. Like every piece of information they need automatically pulls in or it's kind of in their dashboard. They don't have to go searching."

## SUBCODE 5.5: Practice Model Variations

**Definition:** Recognition that different practice models (team-based primary care, preventive health, specialist focused scope, solo practice, etc.) have fundamentally different workflow needs and priorities beyond specialty-specific data requirements.

**When to use:** When providers discuss how their practice model (not just specialty) shapes their needs, or when describing practice-specific workflows.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for specialty clinical data needs (use 5.2) or for general workflow issues (use Code 1).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (MB - PR15):**
> "with me being under Vancouver Coastal Health, the way it works um at our clinic is it's very team- based, which is a way that a lot of primary care is going and and should be going."

**Quote 2 (MB - PR15):**
> "three days of my week is clinical and so that means I'm working as a family doctor, uh, doing primary care for, um, a Vancouver coastal health clinic called Health Connection Clinic, which, uh, serves the marginalized complex population in North Van... a lot of mental health and substance use, um, partially housed, unhoused uh, patient population."

**Quote 3 (JB - PR14):**
> "It's a 1-hour intake call with a nurse preceded by a big questionnaire and then the assessment day is like... four or five hours you know and some of it's just vitals blood pressure heart rate an hour ultrasound an hour with the doctor and an hour with me"

**Quote 4 (JB - PR18):**
> "we want to be very much a complement to your like to the to the care system and your primary care system. We want to be the place for the people like who want to have a little bit more of a proactive approach... not just replace your family doctor."

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR01):**
> "my typical week is not typical. Um, it it is very variable... because you have to be kind of mobile enough to cover emergency things such as an emergency O uh or an extra O day comes up and you're in the O and now you got to cancel a whole office day."

---

## SUBCODE 6.1: Fee-for-Service Billing Limitations

**Definition:** Constraints of fee-for-service models that don't compensate for administrative work, form review, asynchronous interactions, or preparation time outside of face-to-face encounters.

**When to use:** When providers discuss what they can/cannot bill for, or how compensation models limit certain activities.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for alternative payment model discussions or when providers are salaried.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (HG - PR28):**
> "I think the other like practical consideration I'm not sure how those other clinics that are doing the proms followup and stuff but um like how do you bill for that in a fee for service environment um you know there isn't really a fee code for reviewing emails from patients or I mean a little bit but I'd you know you have to figure out what's the what's the you know for phone calls and like direct interaction with patients, it's easier to figure that out in terms of um fee for service, but I don't know how you would do forms."

**Quote 2 (KM - PR21):**
> "Yeah. So now where our billing system is going, which is another big issue in our industry, um a lot of insurers are only paying for one-on-one client time, one-on-one facetime. They're not paying for uh even if I was to use an assistant and that assistant was to perform the one time oneonone time, that's not getting reimbursed by insurance companies. It's just one-on-one facetime... We only have billing codes for actual direct 101 care."

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "I think I think yeah well to be honest with you a lot of these things are uh driven by by compensation models right so so obviously I want the best for my patient right but if their potassium is perfectly fine and I have another 50 lab workup to review and four ultrasound and and three x-rays, right? I want to spend the least amount of time to get as much information and move on to the ne next task because reviewing patient information right in terms of one by one doesn't actually pay me."

**Quote 4 (KM - PR21):**
> "From a MSP standpoint, we only have one billing code for MSP. That's $23 per visit."

**Quote 5 (VW - PR08):**
> "you don't get paid for that phone call. So, it's kind of like why like, you know, I'm I'm spending all this time explaining something, but I'm planning like if I was a specialist, I'd say like I'm I'm explaining all of this stuff to the family doctor for free"

---

## SUBCODE 6.2: Asynchronous Care Billing Opportunities

**Definition:** Potential for providers to bill for asynchronous interactions with patients (reviewing forms, sending communications, ordering tests) that create value and can be compensated.

**When to use:** When providers discuss billing for non-face-to-face interactions, virtual care codes, or revenue from asynchronous activities.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for discussions about barriers to asynchronous billing (use 6.1 instead).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (JH - PR06):**
> "Um and and so I think most would say if you can take information from my patients, triage them into a priority bucket and I review kind of two ends of that bucket... There's also a revenue opportunity in there because you cycle once in an asynchronous way with the doc who says, 'Yes, I'd like to see these tests.' They then order those tests and it all sort of happens with clicks of buttons. They now get to bill for that interaction"

**Quote 2 (JH - PR06):**
> "So if you do it every two days, and remember, you're billing for it, right? So if if you have a list of 50 and you get 20 bucks per and you sit in your bed from 9 to 9:30 before you go to sleep, you just made a,000 bucks and you help your patients. Like it's it's this virtual cycle of everybody winning."

**Quote 3 (JH - PR06):**
> "When you communicate to the patient, uh, you can bill for that and when you communicate to another physician, you can bill for that. And, and they're different billables... Um, so you can have one event where you push a button and it communicates to the patient and creates a bill and it communicates back to the GP and creates a bill."

**Quote 4 (Audrey - PR06):**
> "Sorry, one last question on that billing piece. Um, I understand this we have asynchronous billing codes in BC. Do you know if this is something similar across the provin across the country in different provinces as well? Yeah, it's it's really similar across the country. The amounts vary. some of the preamble language varies."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "Virtual health changed a lot during COVID. Um, which I think a lot of insurance companies are trying to backpedal their way into now. They're trying to get out of it, whereas CO they just had to do it. They had no choice."

---

## SUBCODE 6.3: Cost-Value Considerations

**Definition:** Provider assessment of whether tools are worth the cost, including pricing thresholds, ROI calculations, and comparison to current spending on similar solutions.

**When to use:** When providers discuss pricing, willingness to pay, value proposition, or cost-benefit analysis.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general feature value discussions unrelated to cost.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (RA - PR26):**
> "And then eventually we went to digital services and now it's just all voice transcription. So my letter is ready 10 minutes after the patient has left the room. So the cost used to be much higher when you had typus it I mean with it the costs have come down substantially but it typically used to cost me about $10 for each consultation. And now if I'm paying $30 a month for, hundreds of consultations, we're looking at, a less than a dollar per per consult letter. So, I don't think Heidi is going to be anything to what it used to be in terms of what we transcri. So, I think I'd be happy to pay, $50 to $100 a month for Heidi if it improved my efficiency there."

**Quote 2 (RA - PR26):**
> "There. And That was what I was willing to pay... That was the upper end but still acceptable."

**Quote 3 (JB - PR14):**
> "Um, so I'd say like what's, you know, what's this, like why would someone buy this? Like what's the price point? Why would someone buy this is I guess not, you guys obviously thought about it, but kind of what I would come back to"

**Quote 4 (JB - PR14):**
> "I'll say I'll say quickly and then Natasha, please go. Like I just think the space that's missing is that in between the patient and the clinician. Like you're not like becoming the EMR is a I want to say a pipe or not realistic, but like that's going to be a really hard one to crack. But right there is now there is nothing in the in between. And so if you can fill that space with a good product, I think that cannot like that can just be really impactful on people's lives. like I told Andy like I would buy it."

**Quote 5 (JB - PR18):**
> "Yeah. Well, good luck and let me know when I can buy it."

---

## SUBCODE 6.4: Alternative Payment Models

**Definition:** Discussions of non-fee-for-service payment structures including salary, capitation, hourly compensation, or alternative funding models that enable different workflows.

**When to use:** When providers discuss salaried positions, capitation, or payment models other than traditional fee-for-service.

> "I'm session uh not sessional anymore. I'm salary. So, I'm paid on an hour hourly wage. But um private practice I don't I don't I mean it depends on if they're along in the longitudinal uh family practice model now or fee for service model"

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "I can now in the new British Columbia model of pay for primary care providers, right? I get hourly compensation for reviewing labs and things like that. Right? And I don't need to create an encounter for that. Right? This is at this point it is actually honorbased that well I reviewed 50 labs and this many documentation that I spent about let's say two hours doing that and I build those two hours as admin hours or admin work right."

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "But let's say but on the other hand if it's abnormal I actually uh by informing the patient I actually can bill separately because that becomes actually a visit... So still you still don't get paid other than your admin hours for reviewing right but you get paid separately to discuss it with the patient because that's a virtual visit or you bring them in that's an inerson visit"

**Quote 4 (JH - PR06):**
> "and and so that means an understanding of how they make money and each physician will make money a little bit differently. Um and and so and lining up um sort of what their incentives are with what's best for the patients is sort of the optimal."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "Um, but there's no difference in fee structure. like the doctors had a difference in fee structure, then they complained and they got it all fixed. There's no such thing for us. From a MSP standpoint, we only have one billing code for MSP. That's $23 per visit."

---

## SUBCODE 6.5: Workflow Economic Impact

**Definition:** How economic/billing structures shape clinical workflows and decision-making, including time allocation, task prioritization, and what activities providers choose to do.

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (AA - PR30):**
> "I think I think yeah well to be honest with you a lot of these things are uh driven by by compensation models right so so obviously I want the best for my patient right but if their potassium is perfectly fine and I have another 50 lab workup to review and four ultrasound and and three x-rays, right? I want to spend the least amount of time to get as much information and move on to the ne next task because reviewing patient information right in terms of one by one doesn't actually pay me."

**Quote 2 (JH - PR06):**
> "and and so that means an understanding of how they make money and each physician will make money a little bit differently. Um and and so and lining up um sort of what their incentives are with what's best for the patients is sort of the optimal."

**Quote 3 (HG - PR28):**
> "Um, so right now it's all it's all scheduled. Um, I don't know how I would fit in. I would have to just schedule review of, you know, patient follow-up forms or something as a part of my I'd have to just schedule it as part of my workflow. Um, yeah. So, so it would need to be scheduled."

**Quote 4 (JH - PR06):**
> "The interesting thing is there's also a revenue opportunity in there because you cycle once in an asynchronous way with the doc who says, 'Yes, I'd like to see these tests.' They then order those tests and it all sort of happens with clicks of buttons. They now get to bill for that interaction because they reviewed the patient, they made instructions for the patient and then they'll see the patient back again when the tests are done."

**Quote 5 (MB - PR15):**
> "I I mean it depends on if they're along in the longitudinal uh family practice model now or fee for service model but they they that pain that time might not be compensated right for me in to answer your question so the nurse will spend an hour or so on that I will have the encounter time which will be 30 to 40 minutes with the patient plus I might do 20 minutes of prep."

> "from a clinical standpoint uh basically everything we do is um just through conversation. So we'll take our health history, our medical history... In person yeah and then from college guidelines we're we're regulated to do it for every visit."

**Quote 2 (KM - PR21):**
> "there's no black and white college standard. College standard just says, you know, making sure that you're completing a complete health assessment, which you know, you can write this person has these 10 conditions or you can write this person has no medical history that's going to impact treatment. That would both fly with the college."

**Quote 3 (JH - PR06):**
> "The the the hard part of this is that you need to make sure that this data all ends up in whatever charting system they use so that if they get audited the whether from a medical legal perspective, a billing perspective, it's all there."

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "So I guess it's good in the sense that it makes the physician more accountable for the information but also we have to be aware that there are sometimes things that we omit purposefully because they have no clinical relevance"

**Quote 5 (AA - PR30):**
> "if I'm building a relationship with someone the first few sessions s need to be the the the impactful sessions need to be in person. Again, it's a matter of taste or or philosophy"

> "Um, and I have a look at their medications because it helps kind of frame my differential of what could be going on with them. Um, so I usually look at their whatever it says on the computer for their past medical history and their medications first."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR00):**
> "Um, you know, more often than not, patients will know their disease entities quite well, what they have. Uh, however, um, also depends on how you phrase the question. Like the number of times where I'll go, 'Do you have high blood pressure?' And they'll go, 'No.' And then I look at their meds and they're on anti-hypertensive"

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "Who do you live with? How do you support yourself? Who do you support? And how are the finances?"

**Quote 4 (JH - PR06):**
> "Yeah, I I think if the patient has written it versus said it, I don't think the doctor will trust it more or less. Patients lie a lot.

**Quote 2 (VW - PR08):**
> "Yeah. So, um I would ask it questions about like patients that I'm seeing and um kind of like different uh management options or um or I'd use it to look up guidelines even... So, for example, like I'm just pulling it up so that I can see my history for you. So, I had a a dog bite uh the other day in the emerge. So, I I was I couldn't quite remember the rabies guidelines"

**Quote 2 (JB - PR14):**
> "It's a 1-hour intake call with a nurse preceded by a big questionnaire and then the assessment day is like... four or five hours you know and some of it's just vitals blood pressure heart rate an hour ultrasound an hour with the doctor and an hour with me"

**Quote 3 (JB - PR18):**
> "we want to be very much a complement to your like to the to the care system and your primary care system. We want to be the place for the people like who want to have a little bit more of a proactive approach"

**Quote 4 (JH - PR06):**
> "Um, and I may need to order some tests before they come and see me because I'm sure we've all been to see a doctor where you wait, you wait, you wait, you go in, and then they go, 'Oh, I need an ultrasound, an ECG, and a this before I can answer this question.'"

**Quote 5 (RA - PR26):**
> "So there is some prep to get all that done because a follow-up visit is typically 10 or 15 minutes. It's often on the phone. and you have to in that time get the history, sort out what they've done, go through the results, formulate a plan"

## SUBCODE 7.5: Information Filtering & Relevance

**Definition:** Challenges with patients providing extraneous or tangential information not relevant to their clinical condition, and need for AI to distinguish clinically relevant from irrelevant information.

**When to use:** When providers discuss patients mentioning concerns not related to their visit purpose, or need to filter information for clinical relevance.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for incomplete information (use other codes).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "what Heidi often does is it'll create a little addendum at the bottom, additional information discussed and it'll talk about, the patient talking about lead poisoning in the water... the patients come in with, let's say, an elevated PSA and they're convinced that the lead in the wellwater has caused their PSA to go up, right? So I mean in a way it's good because it recognizes the fact that the patient mentioned it, but it doesn't incorporate it into the main body of the document"

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "I actually want better than intake form, right? I want I want I want your AI AI agent to summarize it and give me the the the important stuff, right?"

**Quote 3 (KM - PR21):**
> "Because to me the me reading through this will also cut into any minimal time that's saved, right?"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR25-2):**
> "we have to be aware that there are sometimes things that we omit purposefully because they have no clinical relevance or where the patient thinks it's very relevant but we realize that it has no bearing on their disease process."

**Quote 5 (AA - PR30):**
> "I want the agent to learn that in meet and greet, Alli cares about these things, right? So I'm gonna put a summary of things that matter to Ally, right, for the meet and greet."

**Quote 2 (VW - PR08):**
> "Um, and I have a look at their medications because it helps kind of frame my differential of what could be going on with them. Um, so I usually look at their whatever it says on the computer for their past medical history and their medications first."

**Quote 3 (CT - PR10):**
> "Yeah. So one it looks like sometimes what it'll do is rather than ask you know what medical history you have it will mention what it knows already so the patient doesn't list it have to list everything"

**Quote 4 (RA - PR26):**
> "it would have been nice if you could have a patient intake form, take the past medical history and at least start to populate some of those fields so that you could make it even more of a list form."

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR01):**
> "the way I would structure it is the HPI getting as much information about the history of the present issues. Then I would have a past urological history and a and then a general past medical history and a past surgical history."

---

## SUBCODE 7.7: Clinical Nuance & Symptom Specificity (NEW)

**Definition:** Need for precise characterization of symptoms that patients may describe imprecisely. Clinical assessment requires complex decision trees and branching logic that adapts based on patient responses.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use for general information gathering or configurable questions (use 5.3).

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (CT - PR10):**
> "Like, you know, are do you actually have symptoms all the time or do they come and go? Because people say, 'Oh, I have symptoms all the time, but oh, I have about two hours during the day where I don't have symptoms, you know.'... So, there's a little bit of that... Yeah, the extra nuance."

**Quote 2 (LT - PR11):**
> "Like I don't ask all these questions to a patient. I take a whole bunch of information and then like go down paths, right?"

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "I fed it some more second order and some tertiary order questions. So for example if you ask the patient have you had any heart disease and they say yes then you're prompted to ask further questions. if they say they've had let's say atrial fibrillation then I want you to ask further about anti-coagulation and rate control"

**Quote 4 (LT - PR11):**
> "You can decipher what conditions they have based on their meds or ask for follow-up information based on the prefilled stuff."

**Quote 5 (KM - PR21):**
> "I can have this exact same condition and give two completely different types of education for it... it becomes so individualistic it becomes too timeconuming because again I I can't use the same you know the three of you can have the same injury with the same pain I can't give all three of you the same education"

So I have quick access to uh let's say the what's available on Cerner... Um but let's say the patient has traveled. So this is very commonly happens to me."

**Quote 2 (AA - PR30):**
> "Obviously, we don't have access to their family doctor's office. We don't know what what their rheatologist told them last time because these are all in private offices, right? But they're very complex and they they end up in hospital every six weeks, right? Every time they come to hospital, it goes by their memory or their son-in-law who took them there and they're not here today."

**Quote 3 (AA - PR30):**
> "I've already reviewed their labs and I actually turn that visit that could if I if if I'm not organized and not well informed, it could be 25 minutes visit. I can actually get it done probably in seven minutes. Believe it or not, in my in my emergency medicine uh practice, uh I don't take notes in front of patients ever"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR01):**
> "my typical week is not typical. Um, it it is very variable... because you have to be kind of mobile enough to cover emergency things such as an emergency O uh or an extra O day comes up and you're in the O and now you got to cancel a whole office day."

**Quote 5 (VW - PR08):**

**Example Quotes:**

**Quote 1 (RA - PR26):**
> "So there is some prep to get all that done because a follow-up visit is typically 10 or 15 minutes. It's often on the phone. and you have to in that time get the history, sort out what they've done, go through the results, formulate a plan, send them prescriptions or new investigations, and dictate a report all in about 10 or 15 minutes."

**Quote 2 (HG - PR28):**
> "So, I that gets booked into my schedule as a phone followup. Um, so right now it's all it's all scheduled... So depending on what I see um someone for I would set a normal followup. So it can range for every anything one month to nine months or a year um depending on what I'm doing with them, how actively I'm managing them versus their primary care provider."

**Quote 3 (HG - PR28):**
> "there are some people that I do telephone followup with like um, you know, two weeks later or something because I've changed some treatment and I want to make sure it's going okay or we're starting to achieve the outcomes."

**Quote 4 (AA - PR30):**
> "But let's say but on the other hand if it's abnormal I actually uh by informing the patient I actually can bill separately because that becomes actually a visit"

**Quote 5 (JH - PR06):**

Again, it's a matter of taste or or philosophy but again this is this is we're thinking of essentially I'm taking u over this patient's sort of part of provision of care primary care."

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR01):**
> "I'll get referred patients for you know history of kidney stones or history of cancer or elevated PSA or blood in the urine or something like that right so I always like to start by addressing the reason they've been referred"

**Quote 3 (JB - PR14):**
> "It's a 1-hour intake call with a nurse preceded by a big questionnaire and then the assessment day is like... four or five hours you know and some of it's just vitals blood pressure heart rate an hour ultrasound an hour with the doctor and an hour with me and then there's a follow-up day which is another hour with me an hour with um another doctor and an hour with the dietitian"

**Quote 4 (MB - PR15):**
> "the nurse will spend an hour or so on that I will have the encounter time which will be 30 to 40 minutes with the patient plus I might do 20 minutes of prep."

**Quote 5 (RA - PR26):**

**Quote 2 (ZM - PR01):**
> "the way I would structure it is the HPI getting as much information about the history of the present issues. Then I would have a past urological history and a and then a general past medical history and a past surgical history."

**Quote 3 (ZM - PR25-1):**
> "in certain areas I asked it to go deeper with second order questions in certain areas like the past psychiatric history I wasn't that keen on knowing that much information on the patient so I had it say look limit your questioning around the past psychiatric to one minute at the most"

**Quote 4 (ZM - PR00):**
> "an orthopedic surgeon might want to know only about whether this person has a bleeding or clotting problem right uh but a cardiologist is going to want to know something very different"

**Quote 5 (ZM - PR00):**

## Inter-Rater Reliability Guidelines

**Coding Process:**
1. Read the entire transcript segment
2. Identify the PRIMARY theme (only one subcode per segment)
3. If multiple themes are present, code to the most dominant/explicit theme
4. Use participant ID format: NAME-TRANSCRIPT# (e.g., VW-PR08)
5. Document rationale for ambiguous cases
6. Use boundary decision table for clarification

**Reliability Checkpoints:**
- Review 10% of coded data between coders
- Calculate Cohen's Kappa (target ≥ 0.80)
- Resolve discrepancies through discussion
- Update codebook definitions as needed
- Track inter-coder disagreements for codebook refinement

## Coding Frequency Tracking

Analysts should track:
- Code frequency by participant
- Code frequency by specialty (family medicine, specialist, allied health)
- Code frequency by practice model (team-based, solo, preventive)
- Code co-occurrence patterns
- Saturation points (when new codes stop emerging)
- Distribution across all 9 main categories
- Prevalence of patient experience themes vs. provider-centric themes

## Completeness Verification

This Version 3.0 Final Edition incorporates:
✅ All themes from original 20-code extraction
✅ All gaps identified from PDF codebook comparison (40 codes)
✅ Patient experience as distinct category
