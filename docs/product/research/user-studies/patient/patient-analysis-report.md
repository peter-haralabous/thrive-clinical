# Understanding the Personal Health Record Experience
## A Qualitative Narrative Synthesis of Patient and Caregiver Perspectives

**Research Team:** Thrive Health Connect
**Date:** November 23, 2025
**Study Population:** 14 patients and caregivers
**Methodology:** Semi-structured interviews with thematic analysis

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This narrative synthesis presents findings from in-depth interviews with 14 patients and caregivers exploring their experiences managing health information, navigating healthcare systems, and coordinating care. The study reveals a healthcare information ecosystem characterized by profound fragmentation, hidden labor, and critical power imbalances that threaten patient safety.

Six major thematic domains emerged: (1) the fragmented information landscape, (2) the hidden labor of care coordination, (3) power dynamics and patient safety crises, (4) the trust paradox in digital health, (5) design needs for diverse users and contexts, and (6) systemic navigation challenges. Most critically, the research uncovered serious patient safety issues—including catastrophic diagnosis communication failures, medication errors causing psychosis, and strategic information withholding due to medical bias—that are largely invisible to healthcare providers and system designers.

The findings challenge assumptions underlying current digital health solutions and point toward design principles that prioritize patient agency, support care relationship quality, and address the structural vulnerabilities that lead to harm.

# 1. INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT

## Study Background

Personal health records (PHRs) represent a significant opportunity to empower patients with access to their health information, yet adoption remains limited and user satisfaction mixed. This qualitative study was designed to understand the lived experience of managing health information from the patient and caregiver perspective, with particular attention to unmet needs, workarounds, and critical incidents that reveal system failures.

## Participant Context

Fourteen participants were recruited representing diverse healthcare engagement levels: patients managing complex chronic conditions (cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiac conditions, diabetes), caregivers supporting aging parents or partners, and individuals navigating diagnostic uncertainty. Participants ranged from minimal healthcare users (quarterly appointments) to intensive users managing 7-8 monthly appointments for family members. Geographic contexts spanned British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, revealing both universal challenges and jurisdiction-specific barriers.

**Participant demographics included:**
- **Age range:** 30s to 80s, with particular representation of adult children caring for aging parents (50s-60s caring for 75-85 year olds)
- **Health complexity:** From single chronic conditions to multiple co-morbidities requiring coordination across 5+ specialists
- **Technology comfort:** From self-described "paper people" to daily AI tool users
- **Healthcare system experience:** Public Canadian system users, recent immigrants experiencing system transitions, and those with comparative private/international healthcare experience
- **Professional context:** Several participants brought healthcare system insider knowledge (former medical office staff, health informatics researchers, senior care advocates, clinical trial coordinators)

## Research Purpose

The study aimed to:
1. Understand how patients and caregivers currently manage health information across fragmented systems
2. Identify pain points, workarounds, and unmet needs in health information access and organization
3. Explore attitudes toward digital health tools, AI, and consolidated health records
4. Uncover critical incidents and safety issues arising from information management failures
5. Inform the design of patient-centered health record solutions that address real-world complexity

## Methodological Approach

Semi-structured interviews lasting 45-90 minutes explored participants' health information management practices, experiences with healthcare encounters, technology attitudes, and reactions to proposed personal health record concepts. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, generating a comprehensive codebook with 10 main codes and 45+ subcodes. This narrative synthesis presents the analytic interpretation of these themes, illustrating findings with participant voices and connecting insights to broader literature and design implications.

# 2. PRESENTATION OF THEMES

## Theme 1: The Fragmented Information Landscape

### Analytic Summary

Health information exists in a state of profound fragmentation across multiple non-communicating systems, creating a data diaspora that participants described with visceral frustration. This fragmentation operates at three levels: **geographic** (records lost when crossing provincial or national borders), **institutional** (each provider maintaining isolated silos), and **format** (incompatible digital systems and persistent paper records). The result is not merely inconvenience but a fundamental epistemological problem—patients and caregivers cannot know what they do not know, cannot access complete histories, and must resort to memory, physical documentation, and manual reconstruction to piece together coherent narratives of health status.

What makes this fragmentation particularly insidious is its invisibility to providers. From within their institutional silos, clinicians may believe they have access to relevant patient information through electronic medical records (EMRs), unaware that critical context—previous diagnoses, specialist consultations, medication trials, adverse reactions—exists in systems they cannot access. Patients become the only consistent thread across these fragmented systems, yet they are given neither the tools nor the authority to effectively bridge the gaps.

The fragmentation manifests in three critical sub-patterns:

**Multi-provider silos:** Each specialist, each hospital, each clinic maintains separate records with minimal data exchange. Participants described treatment teams that appeared unaware of each other's existence, let alone their clinical decisions. This siloing forces patients into an exhausting role as information courier, manually transporting context between providers who make critical decisions based on incomplete pictures.

**Geographic barriers:** Health information proves surprisingly non-portable. Participants who moved between Canadian provinces described complete loss of historical records, as if crossing a provincial border erased their medical past. One participant noted she had "nothing"—no transferred records—after moving from BC to another province, despite decades of documented medical history.

**Format fragmentation:** The coexistence of paper-based, digital, and hybrid record systems creates an archaeological problem. Recent lab results may be digital and accessible; historical records may be paper-based and lost; some information may exist only in provider memory or informal notes. Participants described a temporal decay function where older information becomes progressively less accessible, regardless of its clinical relevance.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P07-CC** (managing father's complex diagnostic journey): "You know, like you said, it's very scattered. There's some stuff I can find in Health Gateway, but it's very generic, you know, like it'll say I went for a hospital procedure, but it won't say that that was a colonoscopy or any of that kind of level of detail."

**P05-MB** (recent cross-provincial move): "I think for me and this is I think really specific because I moved across provinces is that I don't have anything like I don't think they share any information once you sign up for like a new you know a new health care system in a new province. I don't think any records are shared interproincially."

**P08-MK** (patient with lupus): "Like the information I mean you have access to hopefully most or all of your medical information. Maybe not. But even if you do, it's often spread out amongst [different places]."

**P11-RM** (healthcare advocate with professional experience): "And some of that is due to systems not talking to each other. Others are due to access to their own electronic medical records."

**P06-OV** (managing multiple chronic conditions): "I need my rheumatologist and my hypertension person to be able to see each other because I'm trying to get one of them to reduce the medications I'm on because they feel overdubbed."

**P13-MM** (senior care advocate, daughter observing mother's care): "I feel like the health care professionals don't always talk to each other."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

This finding aligns with extensive health informatics literature documenting the "interoperability crisis" in healthcare systems. However, what participants describe goes beyond technical interoperability failures to reveal the **existential burden** placed on patients to serve as the integrative force across fragmented systems—a form of invisible labor that healthcare system design assumes will occur but fails to support or acknowledge.

The fragmentation problem intersects with known health inequities: those with cognitive impairments, limited health literacy, language barriers, or complex medical histories face compounding disadvantages in systems that require sophisticated navigation skills. The participants in this study—many with professional healthcare experience, high health literacy, and strong advocacy skills—struggled profoundly. This raises urgent questions about how more vulnerable populations manage (or fail to manage) information across fragmented systems.

Notably, several participants articulated a sophisticated understanding that fragmentation creates **epistemic uncertainty**—they worried not just about information they knew was missing, but about information they didn't know existed. As P06-OV noted: "if everything's not there but you think everything's there then it becomes more dangerous than useful." This insight reveals a critical design challenge: partial information systems may be worse than no system at all if they create false confidence in completeness.

## Theme 2: The Hidden Labor of Care Coordination

### Analytic Summary

Caregiving in the context of complex healthcare needs involves profound invisible labor that extends far beyond the widely recognized emotional and physical care work. Participants managing healthcare for family members described **detective work**—piecing together medical histories from diaries, phone conversations, incomplete records, and memory—and **translation work**—serving as interpreters between fragmented provider teams who don't communicate directly. This labor is cognitively demanding, emotionally exhausting, and structurally unsupported.

Three patterns of hidden labor emerged with particular clarity:

**Administrative burden:** Managing appointments (sometimes 7-8 monthly for family members), tracking multiple specialists, ensuring test results reach appropriate providers, maintaining medication lists, and coordinating logistics across geographic distances. This work requires project management skills typically unsupported by healthcare systems designed around assumptions of single-patient, single-provider interactions.

**Reconstruction labor:** When formal records are incomplete, fragmented, or inaccessible, caregivers engage in painstaking historical reconstruction—going back through personal diaries from years prior, texting back and forth to fill information gaps, building timelines from memory. This work is particularly invisible because it happens before healthcare encounters, rendering it completely hidden from provider view.

**Intergenerational coordination:** Adult children in their 50s-60s described leveraging professional expertise to support aging parents while simultaneously managing their own health and children's health—creating **three-generation coordination burdens** that strain capacity and exemplify the "sandwich generation" phenomenon in healthcare contexts. What makes this particularly notable is how professional healthcare knowledge (health informatics researchers, senior care advocates, former medical office staff) becomes both a resource and an additional burden—these individuals become de facto case managers for extended family networks precisely because they possess expertise others lack.

Critically, this labor is **socially expected but structurally unsupported**. Healthcare systems assume someone will coordinate, track, remember, advocate, interpret—but provide no tools, training, or acknowledgment of this essential work. The result is profound caregiver overwhelm, with participants describing feeling "disorganized," surviving in "survival mode," and experiencing grief not just from illness but from the exhausting complexity of system navigation itself.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P07-CC** (daughter managing father's diagnostic odyssey): "So, um, he I think has two appointments this week alone along with the fact that every Monday he goes for blood tests and if his hemoglobin is low, he has a transfusion that week and that's been going on basically since May."

**P07-CC** (same participant, describing reconstruction work): "She always keeps a daily diary... she's actually going back in her diary that she writes for her own mental health to go back and see... that's crazy like to go back, you know, a year or two."

**P01-CH** (daughter caring for mother with dementia): "But for me, there was a lot of emotion associated, there was a lot of behavioral stuff, there was a lot of loss, like sort of this this long goodbye of grief."

**P10-MT** (managing partner's healthcare): "I do feel completely disorganized and overwhelmed... there's only one of me I can only do so much."

**P13-MM** (senior care advocate managing mother-in-law's care): "we're trying to be proactive rather than reactive and kind of take the situation to our own hands... we're actually trying to work with one of Connie's team to get um somebody to digitize everything for her so we have a binder to go with when we have a hospital stay."

**P11-RM** (healthcare professional frequently asked to help family/friends navigate): "I get a lot of requests from my family, my relatives, my friends in helping them navigate the system... you shouldn't need a terminal degree to be able to navigate healthcare as a consumer."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

This finding extends feminist scholarship on invisible labor in care work, revealing how **informational labor** represents a distinct but under-recognized dimension of caregiving burden. While research has documented emotional labor, physical care tasks, and financial strain, the cognitive work of information management, coordination, and reconstruction remains largely invisible even in caregiver research literature.

The pattern of **family members with healthcare expertise becoming de facto case managers** for extended networks suggests that current healthcare complexity creates structural dependencies on informal expertise. This raises equity concerns: families without healthcare-savvy members face systemic disadvantages, potentially contributing to worse health outcomes through navigation failures rather than medical factors per se.

Participants' descriptions of "detective work" and "going back through diaries" to reconstruct histories points to what might be termed **historical memory work**—the painstaking labor of building coherent narratives when formal documentation systems fail. This work is particularly gendered, with daughters and wives disproportionately performing this labor, and particularly invisible because it occurs in private, domestic spaces before formal healthcare encounters.

The experience of feeling "completely disorganized and overwhelmed" despite being highly competent, educated individuals with strong advocacy skills suggests that **system complexity exceeds human cognitive capacity** even for well-resourced users. This has profound implications for universal design—if systems overwhelm the most capable users, they are failing everyone, just to varying degrees.

## Theme 3: Power Dynamics and Patient Safety Crises

### Analytic Summary

This theme represents the most critical findings of the study, revealing how **power imbalances in patient-provider relationships create serious patient safety threats** that are largely invisible to healthcare systems and quality improvement efforts. Three interconnected patterns emerged: (1) patients strategically withholding information or using documentation as credibility tools to combat medical dismissiveness, (2) catastrophic breakdowns in diagnosis communication causing trauma and compromised decision-making, and (3) serious medication errors with provider blame-shifting that leaves patients without accountability.

**Strategic information management and credibility battles:** Patients—particularly women, people with complex medical histories, and those from marginalized communities—described needing to strategically manage how they present information to avoid being labeled "hypochondriac," referred to psychiatry inappropriately, or dismissed outright. Several participants articulated sophisticated strategies for establishing credibility: bringing comprehensive documentation to prove they "know what they're talking about," selectively withholding stigmatized diagnoses (HIV, mental health conditions), and carefully calibrating how much information to share to avoid appearing "too complicated."

This dynamic reveals a profound trust breakdown where patients cannot assume providers will take their concerns seriously, leading to **defensive information management**—treating the medical encounter as an adversarial interaction requiring strategic presentation rather than a collaborative inquiry. As one participant noted, health information becomes a "credibility tool" to combat being "patronized" by providers who act as if patient knowledge about their own bodies "just can't be true."

**Catastrophic diagnosis communication failures:** The most striking safety finding involved a participant (P15-GB) who received a life-altering cardiac diagnosis (needing a pacemaker) delivered so casually and with so little support that she experienced complete information blackout, unable to process anything the provider said for the five minutes following the shocking news. She was given complex choices (pacemaker vs. alternative treatments), told to "research it on the internet," received no written materials, had no support person present, and faced time pressure (appointment time was up).

Unable to process the information and lacking adequate guidance, she eventually told the doctor: "Do whatever is easiest, safest, and quickest"—a surrender of patient agency that she continues to regret: "I still don't know if I made the right choice, if I get a pacemaker. And that's a big decision in life." She was never informed about lifestyle implications, daily medications, or ongoing side effects, describing complete "support abandonment" post-procedure.

This pattern represents a **trauma-induced collapse of informed consent**—the patient was technically given choices but under conditions that made meaningful decision-making impossible. The provider likely checked boxes on informed consent protocols, completely unaware that the patient was in shock and unable to process information.

**Medication errors with blame-shifting:** A senior care advocate (P13-MM) described how her mother-in-law received incorrect medications in bubble packs from a pharmacy, causing severe adverse reactions including a week-long psychotic episode. When the error was discovered, "the pharmacist was blaming the doctor and the doctor was blaming the pharmacist"—a system failure where blame circulated among providers while the patient suffered serious harm with no clear accountability.

This incident reveals how **fragmentation enables blame diffusion**: in systems where no one owns the complete picture, errors cascade without accountability, and patients/families must become their own safety officers, implementing private medication reconciliation systems because professional systems failed catastrophically.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P08-MK** (patient with lupus describing credibility battles): "I feel that I'm patronized by the doctors because what do I know, right? What do I know about me?... it's almost like that just can't be true what you're saying... it's it's just empowers me to be confident in going to my appointment... because it shows that I do know what I'm talking about and I think that's huge."

**P11-RM** (describing strategic information withholding): "Say I had HIV or some sort of like STD stigmatizing, you know, you know, condition like mental health that I don't want to share with a provider who I feel could be judgmental. I want to delete it out of this interface but not my main database... if I had a complicated medical history and there are 15 diagnosis um and I'm a woman, one of my concerns would be would the physician think I'm a hypochondriac and refer me to psychiatry, which has happened to my um female friends who are patients."

**P15-GB** (describing catastrophic diagnosis communication): "It was just flabbergasting and the way it was given to me was rather casually. I was stunned. I could not hear anything because I was always used to going to the doctor. Keep on doing what you're doing. You're doing great. And there I didn't hear a thing... I heard nothing for five minutes as that doctor spoke to me... I still don't know if I made the right choice, if I get a pacemaker. And that's a big decision in life."

**P15-GB** (describing support abandonment): "Nobody told me that I'd be taking several medications per day. Nobody. And that was another shock... There was no support afterward after I got this pacemaker."

**P13-MM** (describing medication error cascade): "recently we just had a situation where we were in France and so we weren't around and um the pharmacist actually who was doing the bubble packs they put two of the wrong medications together and she had some really severe reactions to it and was like in psychosis for like a week... the pharmacist was blaming the doctor and the doctor was blaming the pharmacist."

**P08-MK** (describing need to advocate for marginalized patients): "I worked with marginalized communities... multiple multiple um health related issues. And of course, their appearance was one of uh you know, one looked like a garden gnome. So, heaven forbid that we should treat him... unless that person had somebody to go in with them, they didn't get the care that they deserved."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

These findings align with and extend research on **medical dismissiveness**, particularly the well-documented phenomenon of women's pain and symptoms being minimized or attributed to psychological causes. What this research reveals is how patients develop sophisticated **defensive strategies** in response to anticipated dismissiveness—strategic information management becomes a necessary survival skill in systems that cannot be trusted to take patient knowledge seriously.

The concept of health information as a **credibility tool** rather than simply information sharing represents a fundamental shift in understanding patient-provider communication. Information isn't just content; it's a rhetorical device in a power-laden interaction where patient credibility is always potentially in question, particularly for women, people with complex conditions, and marginalized communities.

The catastrophic diagnosis communication case exemplifies what trauma research terms **acute stress response**—the fight/flight/freeze reaction that impairs cognitive processing during extremely threatening information. Healthcare systems operate under assumptions of rational information processing that collapse entirely when patients receive shocking diagnoses. The provider likely believed they were supporting patient autonomy by offering choices and suggesting research; they were completely unaware the patient was in a trauma state incapable of processing complex medical information.

This reveals a profound gap in medical training: providers are trained to disclose diagnoses and obtain informed consent but not necessarily trained to recognize trauma responses or provide the scaffolding (support persons, written materials, follow-up support, time) that makes informed consent possible under emotionally extreme conditions.

The medication error case illustrates **systems-level accountability failures**: when multiple parties (prescribing physician, dispensing pharmacist) share responsibility for medication safety, errors can fall in the gaps between them, with patients bearing the harm while providers engage in blame-shifting. This pattern is well-documented in patient safety literature but remains inadequately addressed in practice.

Taken together, these power dynamic findings reveal that **information tools alone cannot solve safety problems rooted in structural power imbalances and communication failures**. Technology solutions that provide patients with better information access may help with credibility battles but do nothing to address the underlying dismissiveness, trauma-inducing communication practices, or blame diffusion that threaten patient safety.

## Theme 4: The Trust Paradox in Digital Health

### Analytic Summary

Participants exhibited a complex, seemingly paradoxical relationship with digital health technology: simultaneously eager for consolidated health records and deeply anxious about security, accuracy, and business models. This wasn't simple technophobia but rather a sophisticated risk-benefit analysis revealing that **trust in digital health tools operates across multiple dimensions**—data security, information accuracy, algorithmic decision-making, corporate motives, and relationship impacts—and current solutions fail to adequately address these multifaceted concerns.

**The AI dimension:** Responses to AI in healthcare ranged across a spectrum from outright rejection to pragmatic acceptance to enthusiastic adoption. However, even AI-enthusiastic participants (several who used ChatGPT daily) articulated clear boundaries and concerns. The rejection camp worried about **"garbage in, garbage out"** dynamics—AI trained on incomplete or biased data producing flawed outputs—and **privacy implications** of AI processing sensitive health data. The pragmatic camp was comfortable with AI for specific tasks (medical literature review, terminology translation) but wanted to "do the organization myself" for sense-making. The enthusiast camp actively used ChatGPT for interpreting lab results, getting "second opinions," and preparing for appointments.

Critically, AI concerns weren't monolithic "fear of AI" but rather **task-specific appropriateness assessments**: participants distinguished between tasks where AI adds value (summarization, literature search, trend visualization) and tasks where AI threatens important processes (relationship-building with providers, personal sense-making, clinical judgment on complex cases).

**Security and privacy concerns:** Nearly every participant expressed some level of security concern, from mild wariness to deep anxiety. However, what emerged was a **resigned realism**—participants acknowledged "everything's been hacked and everything will continue to be hacked" while simultaneously worrying about health data being used for insurance discrimination, embarrassing breaches, or surveillance.

This reveals not trust but rather a pragmatic acceptance of risk alongside efforts at **selective protection**: avoiding cloud storage, not banking on phones, wanting granular control over which information shares to which contexts. The underlying concern isn't necessarily breach per se but rather **consequences of breach**—health data being weaponized (insurance denial, employment discrimination, social stigma) in ways that financial data typically isn't.

**Platform trust and business models:** Several participants articulated sophisticated questions about business model sustainability: "What is the value add? Is your business model just taking information from me and training your AI? Am I your content?" These questions reflect growing public awareness of data-as-product business models and concerns about health data monetization. Participants wanted transparency about: costs (will this be free or eventually require payment?), data use (is my data being sold? used for training?), longevity (what happens when the platform changes ownership or shuts down?), and governance (who has oversight? what regulation applies?).

The pattern of **system migration anxiety** proved particularly important—participants who had experienced electronic medical record system changes at hospitals described losing access to previous test results, highlighting legitimate fears about information loss during platform transitions. For patients managing complex conditions over decades, the question "will my data survive this company/platform?" isn't abstract but existential.

**Data quality concerns:** Participants worried about **accuracy** ("if everything's not there but you think everything's there then it becomes more dangerous than useful"), **completeness** (patient-entered data limited by health literacy: "people might not know they need to record their allergies"), and **error propagation** ("if there's an error somewhere it just gets repeated... that's the problem with electronic health records").

These concerns reveal sophisticated understanding that data quality issues aren't just inconveniences but potential safety hazards—incomplete records that appear complete create false confidence; incorrect information that propagates across systems becomes harder to correct; patient-entered data without clinical validation may contain critical errors.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P06-OV** (health informatics researcher with outright AI rejection): "the first one is that I will have nothing to do with AI... the privacy matters to me accuracy matters to me... I think that the challenge with AI is that it's garbage in garbage out."

**P11-RM** (scientist, pragmatic AI acceptance with boundaries): "Because I would like to do the organization myself. It helps me think think things through. But if AI can dig into the biomedical literature that's peer-reviewed and offer me citations... but just having AI do a keyword search and like lumping my symptoms together um would not be useful."

**P07-CC** (active ChatGPT user): "I use AI multiple times a day at least... I just got it to summarize this morning for me um a sort of like something I can give to my stepfather's family doctor."

**P11-RM** (on business models and data use): "I would want to know like what is the value ad? Um, even as a user, I kind of want to understand what your business model is. Like, is your business model just taking information from me and training your AI like am I your content?"

**P06-OV** (resigned security realism): "I'm hyper concerned about security but that's just who I am... I'm also perfectly aware that there's nothing that's secure... everything's been hacked and everything will continue to be hacked."

**P04-JC** (insurance discrimination concern): "I am an actuary so I know what an insurance company would say about having my cases that would basically be off of their chart."

**P11-RM** (system migration anxiety): "I've had several incidences in which the hospital system that I was using, they updated their electronic medical records and some of my previous test results could not be found."

**P06-OV** (data quality concern): "if if it did it reliably in the sense of uh like so I guess my question is if everything's not there but you think everything's there then it becomes more dangerous than useful."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

The trust paradox aligns with science and technology studies (STS) research showing that public responses to new technologies are rarely simple acceptance/rejection but rather **conditional, context-dependent appropriation**. Participants weren't asking "should I trust digital health?" but rather "under what conditions, for what purposes, and with what safeguards?"

The **AI appropriateness assessments** participants made mirror findings from human-AI interaction research: people are comfortable with AI for well-bounded, high-volume, pattern-recognition tasks but uncomfortable with AI for tasks requiring judgment, contextual understanding, or high-stakes decisions. The desire to "do the organization myself" reflects recognition that personal sense-making—the cognitive work of understanding one's own health story—has intrinsic value beyond efficiency.

Security concerns reflect growing public awareness of **surveillance capitalism** business models, where personal data is the product. In healthcare contexts, this creates legitimate anxieties because health data is simultaneously highly sensitive (potential for discrimination, stigma) and highly valuable (to pharmaceutical companies, insurers, researchers). Participants' questions about business models reflect savvy, not paranoia.

The **data quality concerns** reveal sophisticated user understanding of a technical principle: **system output quality depends on input quality and data governance**. Participants who worried about incomplete records appearing complete or errors propagating demonstrated understanding of what computer scientists call the "garbage in, garbage out" problem and what safety researchers call "automation bias"—the tendency to trust system outputs even when they're wrong.

What emerges is not a trust/distrust binary but rather a call for **trustworthiness**—demonstrable, verifiable practices around security, data use, quality assurance, and governance that earn confidence through transparency and accountability rather than demanding blind faith.

## Theme 5: Design for Real Users in Real Contexts

### Analytic Summary

Participants responded enthusiastically to **timeline-based, visual health record concepts** while simultaneously articulating sophisticated requirements around accessibility, device preferences, and context-appropriate design. This theme reveals the gap between abstract enthusiasm for "consolidated health records" and the nuanced reality of what makes health information tools actually usable for diverse populations in real-world contexts.

**Timeline and visualization preferences:** Participants showed strong positive reactions to chronological representations that show "all the different things" on one page, with particular appreciation for being able to see **temporal density**—when multiple health events cluster together. As one participant noted: "this really really like shows that visual of what's been going on. like when there's this frequency all of a sudden where a whole bunch of things are happening at the same time." This desire for timeline views reflects the narrative structure humans use to make sense of health journeys—not just discrete facts but stories with arcs, patterns, and causality over time.

**Accessibility for elderly users:** Multiple participants caring for aging parents articulated specific accessibility requirements that go beyond standard accessibility guidelines: "plain language" over clinical terminology, "friendly" rather than "clinical" interfaces, "pictures and symbols" not just text, radically simplified navigation (click directly to prescriptions, not deep menu trees), and automatic data population rather than manual entry requirements.

Critically, accessibility wasn't framed as "dumbing down" but rather as **reducing cognitive load** during high-stress health moments when everyone—regardless of age—has limited processing capacity. One participant noted that even though her 84-year-old mother is "actually pretty good with an iPhone," asking her to "log in with her BC services card" created confusion and abandonment.

**Device and modality preferences:** A striking finding was the diversity of device preferences—some wanted "mostly on desktop" because screens are bigger for forms; others needed phone-based access because "the phone was the thing I had reliably with me" during crisis periods; still others strongly preferred paper ("I prefer things in paper... I think a binder would be much easier for me"). This heterogeneity challenges assumptions about digital-first design and suggests need for **multi-modal access strategies** that meet users where they are rather than forcing mode compliance.

**Context-appropriate design:** Several participants distinguished between what they needed during acute crisis ("survival mode," "just focusing on getting through") versus maintenance periods. During crises, simplicity and reliability trump comprehensiveness; during stable periods, detailed exploration and organization become valuable. This temporal variation in user needs suggests that **context-adaptive interfaces**—different modes for crisis vs. maintenance—may better serve real usage patterns than single, static designs optimized for a mythical "average" use case.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P06-OV** (on timeline visualization): "That's nice. I like I like that one. I like that one... I like the fact that I can see it all on one page, all the different things... And the fact is is that you not just have the MCL tear left, you have fell rollerblading."

**P07-CC** (on temporal density visualization): "this is amazing... this really really like shows that visual of what's been going on. like when there's this frequency all of a sudden where a whole bunch of things are happening at the same time."

**P03-CM** (on elderly accessibility needs): "um easy uh as in um finding the information by maybe having it um very worded very easily for regular people. Um, and maybe even more specifically for the things that elderly people deal with... Well, like pictures, you know, that's always an interesting way to do it. I think for older people that might be a good idea."

**P01-CH** (on device needs during crisis): "I I felt like I was just surviving... the phone was the thing I had reliably with me so that ability to kind interface on the phone would have been kind of critical."

**P15-GB** (on paper preference): "I prefer things in paper... I think a binder would be much easier for me."

**P04-JC** (on context-specific needs): "how to say it without looking ridiculous, but it's a little bit of a survival mode. So right now I'm just focusing on getting through."

**P04-JC** (on general positive reception): "Perfect. I think you're on the right track. I would like to have a system like that."

**P13-MM** (on user-friendliness): "I think it's really I think it's really user friendly."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

The strong preference for **timeline visualization** aligns with narrative medicine research showing that humans understand health through stories, not data points. Timelines support what psychologists call "episodic memory"—memory organized around events and experiences rather than abstract facts. By showing temporal density (multiple events clustering), timelines also support pattern recognition that may not be evident in lists or tables.

The accessibility requirements articulated by participants caring for elderly parents extend universal design principles by emphasizing **cognitive accessibility**—not just visual/motor accessibility but reducing the working memory demands, inference requirements, and navigation complexity that create barriers for older adults or anyone under cognitive stress (which includes most people during healthcare crises).

The heterogeneity of device preferences challenges the technology adoption literature's typical assumption of preference convergence around "preferred" devices. Instead, what emerges is **situated device appropriateness**—different devices for different contexts (crisis vs. maintenance), different capabilities (small screen portability vs. large screen detail), and different comfort levels (digital natives vs. "paper people"). This suggests that multi-modal strategies aren't just accessibility accommodations but core design requirements for serving diverse populations.

The distinction between crisis and maintenance mode needs maps onto **dual-process theories** in cognitive psychology: System 1 (fast, intuitive) versus System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking. During crises, users need System 1 interfaces—simple, clear, reliable. During maintenance, they can engage System 2—explore, analyze, organize. Single interfaces optimized for one mode will fail in the other.

## Theme 6: Navigating a System Not Built for Patients

### Analytic Summary

Participants described healthcare systems that feel fundamentally **designed for provider convenience rather than patient navigation**, creating systemic barriers that require sophisticated workarounds, insider knowledge, and exhausting advocacy to overcome. This theme encompasses the labor of self-education, provider coordination failures, access barriers, and the advantaging of those with healthcare system literacy—revealing how system design choices create structural inequities.

**Self-education imperatives:** Participants described extensive self-directed learning—Googling symptoms, reading PubMed articles, using ChatGPT to translate medical terminology, researching treatment options—as **necessary survival skills** rather than optional enrichment. As one participant stated: "I have always had a strong sense that advocacy in the health system is required." This framing of advocacy as "required" rather than beneficial reveals a system that doesn't function adequately for passive patients but only for those who actively educate and advocate for themselves.

The self-education pattern creates a troubling dynamic: providers dismiss patient research ("are you smart enough to read your own results?") while simultaneously providing inadequate information themselves, forcing patients into a double bind—neither trusting provider-only information nor having provider trust in patient-gathered information.

**Provider interoperability failures:** The technical failure of systems to communicate is well-documented, but participants articulated its human cost: specialists "passing the buck" without coordination, rheumatologists and hypertension specialists unable to see each other's medications when deprescribing is clinically indicated, diagnostic delays because test results don't reach appropriate providers. One participant managing a parent's diagnostic odyssey described how "no one seems to be able out of all of these specialists... to consolidate" information, resulting in months of diagnostic uncertainty and ongoing symptoms without resolution.

These coordination failures aren't just inefficiencies—they represent **diagnostic risks** (delayed or missed diagnoses when critical information doesn't reach decision-makers) and **treatment risks** (polypharmacy, drug interactions, contradictory recommendations when specialists work in isolation).

**Access barriers and wait times:** While wait times dominated surface-level complaints, deeper analysis revealed that access problems create a **cascade of consequences**: delayed diagnoses, worsening conditions, patient suffering, and ultimately higher healthcare costs when conditions that could have been managed simply become complex emergencies. One participant waited over a year for an MRI needed to diagnose and treat severe sciatica—a year of pain, lost work productivity, and increasing medication dependence because the diagnostic tool wasn't accessible in a timely manner.

The wait time problem also creates **information decay**: by the time appointments occur, symptoms may have changed, memories have faded, and patients struggle to provide the detailed history that delayed appointments were supposed to allow for careful evaluation.

**Healthcare system literacy advantage:** Several participants brought professional healthcare experience—former medical office staff, health informatics researchers, clinical scientists, senior care advocates—and this insider knowledge dramatically shaped their navigation capacity. They knew how to request records, which questions to ask, how to escalate concerns, when to insist versus when to defer. This **literacy privilege** raises profound equity questions: if successful navigation requires professional healthcare knowledge, what happens to everyone without that advantage?

One participant who helps family and friends navigate stated bluntly: "you shouldn't need a terminal degree to be able to navigate healthcare as a consumer." Yet current system complexity effectively requires exactly that, creating structural advantages for the educated, professionally connected, and health-literate.

**Diagnostic odysseys:** Perhaps the most striking system failure pattern involved patients experiencing months or years of unexplained symptoms, passed between multiple specialists, undergoing repeated testing without resolution. One participant's father has been "coughing up blood every day since May," has seen "I don't even remember how many specialists," receives weekly blood transfusions, yet "no one seems to be able... out of all of these specialists... [to] just keep passing the buck" to identify the underlying cause.

These diagnostic odysseys reveal **coordination failures at scale**: in fragmented systems without clear ownership or care integration, complex cases fall through cracks. Each specialist rules out their domain without taking responsibility for the whole patient. The result is exhausting for patients/families, expensive for systems, and dangerous when serious conditions remain undiagnosed.

### Illustrative Quotes

**P01-CH** (on advocacy imperative): "I was a massive Googler. Like I gain I I have always had a strong sense that advocacy in the health system is required."

**P04-JC** (on dismissiveness of patient research): "are you smart enough to read your own results? This is where I'm getting a little frustrated because sure I want to have all good news, but if this is bad news, I still need to understand them."

**P07-CC** (on diagnostic odyssey): "he's been coughing up blood every day since May... he has been to I don't even remember how many specialists... and no one seems to be able out of all of these specialists that to me just keep passing the buck."

**P13-MM** (on access barriers): "once I actually saw the doctor, got on the list to get an MRI, it took me over a year to get actually an MRI done before they could actually refer me to a neurosurgeon."

**P11-RM** (on system literacy privilege): "I get a lot of requests from my family, my relatives, my friends in helping them navigate the system... you shouldn't need a terminal degree to be able to navigate healthcare as a consumer."

**P06-OV** (on provider coordination failure): "I need my rheumatologist and my hypertension person to be able to see each other because I'm trying to get one of them to reduce the medications I'm on because they feel overdubbed."

**P11-RM** (on interoperability failures): "And some of that is due to systems not talking to each other. Others are due to access to their own electronic medical records."

**P03-CM** (on access as priority need): "If given a 'magic wand,' P03-CM's primary wish for improving their healthcare experience is to be able to see doctors more quickly."

### Interpretation & Knowledge Connections

The self-education imperative aligns with **patient activation** research showing that engaged, informed patients achieve better health outcomes. However, what participants reveal is how this pattern becomes problematic when **activation is required, not supported**—when systems function adequately only for activated patients, creating systematic disadvantages for those unable or unwilling to extensively self-educate and advocate.

The provider interoperability failures have been extensively documented in health IT research, but what participants add is the **patient perspective on coordination failure costs**: not just technical problems but experienced suffering, diagnostic delays, and safety risks. The phrase "passing the buck" captures the moral dimension—providers abdicating responsibility rather than taking ownership of coordination when systems fail to support it technically.

The diagnostic odyssey pattern aligns with research on **rare disease diagnosis** (often taking 5-7 years and requiring 8+ physicians) but extends it to show how even relatively common conditions become "diagnostic odysseys" in fragmented systems where no one owns the complete picture. This suggests that system fragmentation, not just disease rarity, drives diagnostic delays.

The healthcare literacy advantage finding connects to **health literacy** research showing that lower health literacy correlates with worse health outcomes. What this research adds is recognition that current system complexity creates functional health literacy requirements far exceeding typical health literacy interventions (teaching people to read medication labels). The system requires research skills, medical terminology comprehension, navigation sophistication, and advocacy capacity that most people lack regardless of general education level.

# 3. CROSS-THEME NARRATIVE

## Weaving Connections Across Themes

The six themes identified in this research are not discrete problems but rather interconnected dimensions of a single, systemic crisis: **healthcare systems designed primarily for provider institutional needs, not patient information needs, creating a fragmented, inequitable landscape that demands invisible labor, privileges health literacy, and creates serious safety risks when power imbalances intersect with communication failures.**

### From Fragmentation to Labor

Information fragmentation (Theme 1) directly creates care coordination labor (Theme 2). When records scatter across non-communicating systems, someone must do the integration work—and that someone defaults to patients and family caregivers. The system saves money by not investing in interoperability infrastructure, effectively outsourcing that cost to unpaid patient labor. This labor distribution is invisible to healthcare systems that see only their internal costs, not the external costs they impose on patients.

Critically, this labor isn't evenly distributed: those with **healthcare system literacy** (Theme 6) can perform this work more efficiently; those without struggle or fail entirely. The result is a system that appears to "work" for sophisticated, educated, professionally connected users while failing more vulnerable populations—but because failures are private (occurring in homes, not healthcare facilities), they remain invisible to quality improvement efforts focused on measurable institutional metrics.

### From Labor to Power

The coordination labor patients must perform intersects with **power dynamics** (Theme 3) in critical ways. When patients arrive at appointments having done extensive research, compiled comprehensive documentation, and prepared questions, they may be dismissed as "difficult" or "hypochondriac" rather than recognized as doing necessary work that systems fail to support. The very documentation patients create as survival tools becomes evidence they can use in credibility battles—but only if providers give it legitimate consideration rather than viewing patient knowledge as threat to provider authority.

The power dynamics theme also reveals how **information systems alone cannot solve relationship problems**. Giving patients better documentation may help them establish credibility with dismissive providers, but it doesn't address the underlying dismissiveness. Worse, it may simply raise the bar: if everyone has comprehensive documentation, credibility battles escalate to new domains rather than disappearing.

### From Power to Safety

The most critical connections involve how power imbalances create **patient safety crises** (Theme 3). The catastrophic diagnosis communication case shows what happens when providers fail to recognize patient trauma states and how information overload without support causes agency collapse—patients surrendering decision-making ("do whatever is easiest") not from preference but from overwhelm. The medication error case shows how blame diffuses in fragmented systems, leaving patients harmed without accountability. The strategic information withholding pattern shows how lack of trust leads patients to hide information that might be clinically relevant, creating risks that manifest later when conditions worsen or interact with treatments.

These safety issues are **structurally produced**: they arise not from individual provider failures but from system designs that fragment care, create time pressure, fail to support trauma-informed communication, and establish adversarial rather than collaborative patient-provider relationships. Information tools that don't address these structural issues may improve efficiency without improving safety—or may even worsen safety if they create false confidence in information quality while underlying relationship and coordination problems persist.

### Trust as Precondition

The **trust paradox** (Theme 4) runs underneath all other themes. Patients need consolidated health records to manage fragmented information and reduce coordination labor—but they won't adopt tools they don't trust. Trust isn't binary (trust/don't trust) but multidimensional: security trust, accuracy trust, business model trust, algorithmic trust, and crucially, **relationship impact trust**—whether tools will harm or help the patient-provider relationship.

Several participants expressed concern that comprehensive documentation might replace rather than support provider conversations, or that AI summarization might cause providers to stop listening. This worry—that efficiency tools might degrade care relationship quality—reflects sophisticated understanding that **healthcare isn't just information exchange but relationship**. Design choices that optimize for information transfer efficiency while degrading relationship quality may be false optimizations, potentially worsening outcomes even as they improve metrics.

### Design Implications as Response

The design needs theme (Theme 5) must be understood not just as feature requests but as responses to the failures documented in other themes. Timeline visualization isn't just aesthetic preference—it's a tool for understanding causality and pattern recognition in fragmented information landscapes. Accessibility requirements aren't just accommodation—they're recognition that cognitive load is high and variable, requiring radical simplification. Multi-modal access (phone, desktop, paper) isn't just convenience—it's acknowledgment that different contexts (crisis vs. maintenance) and different users (digital natives vs. paper-preferring elderly) require different affordances.

Most critically, participants' **enthusiastic reception of consolidated health record concepts** must be understood as conditional enthusiasm—"yes, if you can solve trust, security, accuracy, relationship impact, accessibility, and agency concerns." Enthusiasm isn't adoption permission; it's recognition of need alongside sophisticated awareness of implementation challenges.

### Overlaps and Tensions

Several productive tensions emerged across themes:

**Efficiency vs. Relationship Quality:** Tools that make information exchange more efficient might degrade relationship quality if they reduce conversation time or create screen-time barriers during encounters. This tension requires design choices that support rather than replace human connection.

**Comprehensiveness vs. Overwhelming:** Patients want complete health pictures but feel overwhelmed by information volume. This tension suggests need for **progressive disclosure designs**—simple views by default with optional depth—rather than choosing between comprehensiveness and simplicity.

**Patient Agency vs. Provider Authority:** Empowering patients with information and tools can threaten providers who view patient knowledge as authority challenge. This tension requires organizational culture change, not just tool design—tools that work within current culture rather than requiring culture change as prerequisite.

**Accessibility vs. Sophistication:** Designing for elderly users or those in crisis requires simplification; designing for highly engaged, health-literate users requires sophistication. This tension suggests **multi-level designs** serving different user segments rather than single compromise designs serving no one well.

**Control vs. Convenience:** Patients want control over information (selective sharing, granular permissions, data sovereignty) but convenience requires automation and pre-configuration. This tension requires thoughtful defaults that respect privacy while allowing override rather than forcing choice at every decision point.

# 4. DISCUSSION & IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING

## How Themes Answer Research Questions

### RQ1: How do patients and caregivers currently manage health information?

The research reveals a **complex ecosystem of workarounds**: manual tracking systems (paper lists, phone notes, Word documents), memory aids, personal documentation, and informal coordination through family networks. Critically, these workarounds aren't just alternatives to formal systems but **essential compensations for system failures**. Formal health records exist but prove inadequate—fragmented, inaccessible, incomplete—forcing patients to create parallel personal information systems.

The management strategies differ dramatically by health complexity and healthcare system literacy. Simple users (infrequent appointments, straightforward conditions) may rely on memory and passive receipt of care. Complex users (multiple specialists, chronic conditions, caregiving responsibilities) develop sophisticated personal information management practices out of necessity, not preference. Healthcare insiders leverage professional knowledge to navigate effectively; others struggle without that advantage.

### RQ2: What are the pain points and unmet needs?

**Fragmentation** emerges as the fundamental pain point underlying all others: fragmented systems create access barriers, coordination burden, information gaps, provider communication failures, and patient safety risks. But fragmentation alone doesn't fully explain the pain—it's fragmentation **combined with lack of patient-centered integration support** that creates crisis. Systems fragment for institutional reasons (different vendors, competitive dynamics, regulatory boundaries) while expecting patients to bear integration costs.

**Power imbalances** represent the most critical unmet need: patients need to be believed, taken seriously, and treated as credible sources of information about their own bodies. No information tool solves this unless it addresses underlying dismissiveness, time pressure, and adversarial dynamics that cause patients to withhold information or surrender agency under pressure.

**Accessibility across cognitive states** represents a design gap: current tools optimize for stable, unhurried decision-making but fail during crisis when cognitive capacity is limited and need is highest. Tools that work well for health-literate users exploring information during calm moments fail for overwhelmed caregivers or patients in trauma states.

### RQ3: What are attitudes toward digital health tools and consolidated records?

Attitudes are **conditionally positive**: participants recognize value in consolidated records while articulating sophisticated concerns about security, accuracy, business models, relationship impacts, and accessibility. This isn't resistance to change but rather **informed skepticism based on past experience with fragmented systems, incomplete information, technology failures, and privacy breaches**.

The trust paradox reveals that digital health tool adoption requires earning trust across multiple dimensions simultaneously—no single "killer feature" creates adoption if fundamental trustworthiness questions remain unaddressed. Security, accuracy, transparency, accessibility, and relationship quality must all reach threshold adequacy for adoption to occur at scale.

**AI attitudes** specifically prove highly task-dependent: participants comfortable with AI for bounded tasks (summarization, literature search, trend visualization) remain uncomfortable with AI for judgment tasks (diagnosis, treatment decisions, care relationship mediation). This nuanced view challenges both AI-enthusiast narratives ("AI will transform healthcare") and AI-skeptical narratives ("patients won't accept AI"), suggesting instead that **task-appropriate AI deployment**—AI supporting rather than replacing human judgment—may find acceptance.

### RQ4: What critical incidents reveal system failures?

Three critical incident patterns emerged with safety implications:

**Catastrophic diagnosis communication** showing how trauma responses impair informed consent, requiring support structures (time, written materials, support persons, follow-up) that current practice often fails to provide. This isn't rare—most serious diagnoses involve emotional reactions that impair processing—but systems design around assumptions of rational information processing that collapse under stress.

**Medication errors with blame diffusion** showing how fragmentation enables accountability gaps: when prescriber, dispenser, and administerer are separate with imperfect communication, errors can fall between parties while patients suffer harm. The "pharmacist blamed doctor, doctor blamed pharmacist" pattern reveals how systemic coordination failures manifest as interpersonal blame-shifting.

**Strategic information withholding due to bias concerns** showing how lack of trust creates safety risks: when patients fear dismissal or psychiatric referral for disclosing complex histories, they withhold information that may be clinically relevant. The patient intending to protect themselves from bias ironically creates safety risks by giving providers incomplete pictures.

### RQ5: How should patient-centered solutions be designed?

The findings suggest **multi-layered design requirements**:

**Foundation layer:** Data quality, security, interoperability—must be trustworthy before higher-level features matter. If foundation isn't solid, everything else is built on quicksand.

**Information layer:** Visualization, organization, search, timeline views—supporting both simple access (crisis mode) and deep exploration (maintenance mode). Progressive disclosure allowing appropriate depth for context.

**Relationship layer:** Supporting rather than replacing patient-provider connection. Tools should prepare patients for conversations, document outcomes, reduce repetitive information gathering—but never replace the conversation itself.

**Agency layer:** Giving patients control (selective sharing, granular permissions, data sovereignty) while reducing burden through intelligent defaults and automation where appropriate. Control without work.

**Equity layer:** Ensuring accessibility across age, health literacy, cognitive states, and technology comfort. No universal design serves all users; multi-modal strategies required.

## Contribution to Broader Knowledge

### Theoretical Contributions

**Information work as care work:** This research extends care work theory by identifying **informational labor**—reconstruction, coordination, translation work—as a distinct but under-recognized dimension of caregiving. While emotional labor and physical care tasks are well-documented, the cognitive work of managing health information remains largely invisible even in care work scholarship.

**Stratified adoption:** The findings challenge simple technology adoption models by revealing **context-dependent, task-specific, relationship-aware adoption decisions**. Patients don't uniformly accept or reject digital health tools but rather make nuanced assessments about which tools for which purposes under which conditions with which safeguards. This suggests need for adoption theories that account for multidimensional trust and context variation.

**Defensive documentation:** The concept of health information as **credibility tool** extends patient-provider communication research by identifying a defensive function: documentation serves not just to inform but to establish legitimacy in contexts where patient knowledge is presumptively suspect. This has implications for power dynamics research and medical sociology.

**Trauma-informed consent:** The catastrophic diagnosis case contributes to informed consent literature by highlighting how **emotional states impair consent capacity**—consent isn't just about information provision but about recipient capacity to process, which varies dramatically by emotional state. This suggests need for trauma-informed consent practices recognizing that shocking diagnoses create temporary processing impairment requiring additional support.

### Practical Contributions

**System design implications:** The findings challenge health IT design assumptions around information completeness, rational user behavior, and universal interfaces. Real-world complexity requires **progressive disclosure, context adaptation, multi-modal access, and relationship-centered rather than information-centered design**.

**Policy implications:** The fragmentation crisis documented here suggests need for **structural interoperability mandates** rather than voluntary standards—market forces alone haven't solved interoperability in two decades and won't without regulatory intervention. Additionally, the invisible labor findings suggest need for recognizing and supporting caregiver coordination work through respite resources, care coordination services, or compensation structures.

**Clinical training implications:** The power dynamics and communication failures documented suggest need for **enhanced clinical communication training** around trauma-informed disclosure, recognizing dismissiveness bias (particularly toward women and complex patients), and understanding how time pressure impairs relationship building. Provider training typically focuses on technical knowledge; this research suggests relational and communication competencies require equal investment.

### Equity Implications

The **healthcare literacy advantage** finding reveals how current system complexity creates structural inequities favoring those with professional healthcare knowledge, education, resources, and advocacy capacity. This suggests that quality improvement efforts focused on measurable institutional outcomes may miss the most serious failures—those occurring in private spaces (homes, not hospitals) for the most vulnerable populations (low literacy, limited resources, complex needs).

Design solutions must explicitly address equity: not just "accessible to disabled users" but accessible to **cognitively overwhelmed users, health-illiterate users, digitally uncomfortable users, elderly users, and users in crisis**. Universal design principles apply but require extending beyond physical accessibility to cognitive and social accessibility.

# 5. DESIGN IMPLICATIONS

## Strategic Framework

Design implications are organized around six thematic clusters, each following the structure: (1) User Need → Design Principle, (2) Current Landscape, (3) Gap/Opportunity, and (4) Implication for Us. This framework connects user insights to both product-level and market-level strategic opportunities.

---

## DOMAIN 1: Information Architecture & Integration

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Patients and caregivers face profound information fragmentation across geographic, institutional, and format boundaries, requiring exhausting manual reconstruction of coherent health histories.

**Design Principle:** *Comprehensive Integration with Epistemic Transparency*
Aggregate information from all available sources while making aggregation boundaries explicit—never create false confidence in completeness. Support patient-driven integration work (manual record addition, scanning, data entry) while automating wherever possible.

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**
- **Health system portals** (MyChart, Health Gateway): Provide access to single-institution records but create proliferation of accounts, login barriers, and geographic silos. Each institution's portal shows only its data, often with significant delays (3-5 days for lab results).
- **Apple Health Records:** Aggregates data from participating healthcare institutions using FHIR standard, solving multi-institution problem for iPhone users at participating facilities. However, coverage remains limited (requires institutional adoption), excludes Android users (58% global market share), and offers minimal organization/interpretation features beyond raw data aggregation.
- **Personal health record platforms** (Microsoft HealthVault, Google Health—both discontinued): Attempted comprehensive aggregation but struggled with data quality, user engagement, and business model sustainability. Failures highlight market risk.
- **Patient data aggregators** (PatientsLikeMe, Hugo Health): Community platforms or concierge services requiring manual data upload or records requests on patient behalf—solving problem but shifting labor.

**Common patterns:**
- **Institution-centric views:** Most portals designed for providers' institutional perspective, not patients' longitudinal cross-institutional journey
- **Read-only access:** Patients can view but not meaningfully organize, annotate, or correct records
- **Technical interoperability focus:** Industry concentrates on FHIR standards and EMR data exchange while ignoring that most patients' information exists outside EMRs (home monitoring, symptom tracking, historical paper records, cross-border care)

**Best practices:**
- **Automatic data retrieval** (Apple Health): Integration with institutional systems eliminating manual records requests
- **Timeline visualization** (some fitness apps, not prevalent in health records): Showing health events chronologically rather than categorically
- **Provider-shareable views** (rare): Ability to generate comprehensive summaries suitable for giving to new providers

### Gap / Opportunity

**Underserved needs:**
1. **Cross-border health information:** No existing solution adequately handles international or interprovincial care histories. Participants moving between Canadian provinces or countries described complete information loss, yet this represents 13% of Canadian population moving provinces in 5-year periods, plus all international immigrants with health histories.

2. **Historical information integration:** Most platforms focus on recent digital data (post-EMR adoption, roughly 2010+). Patients with decades of health history—particularly those with chronic conditions—need integration of pre-digital records. No consumer-focused solution handles scanning, OCR, and intelligent integration of historical paper records at scale.

3. **Epistemic uncertainty management:** Current platforms fail to communicate what they don't know. Partial data appears complete, creating false confidence. Opportunity: explicitly marking coverage boundaries, showing data sources, highlighting gaps, and supporting patient annotation ("I know I had surgery in 2005 but don't have records").

4. **Cross-format integration:** Health information exists as clinical records, lab results, radiology images, pharmacy records, wearable data, patient-reported symptoms, genetic information, and more. No platform integrates across all formats with consistent visualization and search.

5. **Caregiver-oriented aggregation:** Current tools assume single-patient use. Caregivers managing parents/partners/children need to track multiple people's information with clear separation but easy switching. No consumer platform designed specifically for caregiver coordination use cases.

**Competitor trade-offs:**
- **Apple Health Records:** Excellent automatic integration for participating institutions but excludes Android majority, requires institutional adoption (barrier for small clinics), provides minimal interpretation/organization features, and offers no support for non-EMR data sources.
- **Patient portal proliferation:** Each institution provides its own portal, fragmenting user experience and creating authentication burden (many participants mentioned 5+ different portals with different logins).
- **Comprehensive aggregation platforms (failed):** HealthVault and Google Health attempted comprehensive aggregation but required excessive manual data entry, struggled with engagement, and couldn't sustain business models. Trade-off: comprehensiveness requires effort that users won't sustain without immediate value.

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as the **"complete picture platform"** that solves fragmentation more comprehensively than institution-centric portals while avoiding the manual effort burden that killed previous aggregation attempts.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Intelligent automation with manual fallback:**
   - **Automated retrieval** from EMR systems (FHIR integration matching Apple Health's approach) for institutions that support it
   - **Concierge records requests** for institutions without APIs (human-assisted retrieval as premium tier, removing patient burden)
   - **Smart document scanning/OCR** for historical records with AI-assisted data extraction (photos of paper records → structured data)
   - **Wearable/monitoring integration** (Fitbit, Apple Watch, glucose monitors) for continuous data
   - **Manual entry streamlined** with intelligent templates and voice input for filling gaps

2. **Epistemic transparency:**
   - **Source indicators** showing where each piece of information came from and when it was retrieved
   - **Gap highlighting** explicitly showing "we don't have information from [facility] for [date range]" rather than implying completeness
   - **Patient annotations** allowing "I know I had X but don't have records" to capture information beyond formal documentation
   - **Confidence scores** where AI extracts information (95% confident this means X, review recommended)

3. **Cross-border specialty:**
   - **International care history support** with multi-language OCR, unit conversion (metric/imperial), and format adaptation
   - **Provincial/state transition assistance** helping patients request and transfer records when moving
   - **Travel health preparation** generating comprehensive summaries for international travel or cross-border care

4. **Caregiver-first features:**
   - **Multi-patient management** with clear visual separation and role-based permissions
   - **Family sharing controls** allowing adult children to manage parent information with appropriate consent/audit trails
   - **Care team coordination** supporting multiple family members tracking shared responsibility (who went to appointment? what was outcome?)

**Business model differentiation:**
Hybrid freemium model addressing sustainability concerns that killed previous platforms:
- **Free tier:** Automatic EMR aggregation for participating institutions (following Apple Health model) with basic timeline view
- **Premium tier ($10-15/month):** Concierge records requests, advanced organization features, unlimited document storage, AI analysis
- **Family tier ($25-30/month):** Multi-patient management for caregivers
- **B2B integration:** Partner with health systems/insurers who provide premium tier as member benefit (creating sustainable revenue independent of direct consumer payment)

**Technical innovation focus:**
Invest in **intelligent document processing** (IDP) pipeline: scanning → OCR → entity extraction → structured data creation → quality review workflow. This technical capability becomes competitive moat—difficult for competitors to replicate and creates defensible value (converting unstructured historical records into usable data).

---

## DOMAIN 2: Care Coordination & Caregiver Support

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Caregivers manage exhausting invisible labor—coordination across providers, appointment scheduling, medication tracking, historical reconstruction—that healthcare systems assume will occur but don't support.

**Design Principle:** *Make Invisible Labor Visible & Supported*
Design features that explicitly recognize caregiver work, reduce coordination burden through automation, support delegation/collaboration, and provide caregiver-specific tools (not just patient tools used by caregivers).

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**
- **Health system portals with proxy access:** Most EMR patient portals now offer "authorized representative" or "proxy access" allowing family members to view patient records. However, these are permission layers on patient-facing tools, not purpose-built caregiver coordination features.
- **Caregiving apps** (Caring Village, CaringBridge, Carely): Primarily **social coordination tools** (scheduling visitor help, meal trains, communication updates) rather than medical information management.
- **Medication management apps** (Medisafe, MyTherapy): Help track when medications taken but don't solve inter-provider medication reconciliation or coordination challenges.
- **Calendar/task apps** (Google Calendar, Todoist): General-purpose tools adapted to caregiving but lacking healthcare-specific features (appointment types, medication schedules, symptom tracking).

**Common patterns:**
- **Patient-centric design adapted for caregivers:** Tools designed for patients, then permission-extended to caregivers—inheriting patient-centric assumptions that don't fit caregiver workflows
- **Social vs. medical separation:** Social coordination platforms (CaringBridge) and medical information platforms (MyChart) remain separate, forcing caregivers to manage both independently
- **Single-patient assumption:** Most tools assume one person manages their own care, not one person managing multiple family members' care

**Best practices:**
- **Shared care plans** (some enterprise care coordination platforms): Provider-facing tools allowing care team to see coordinated plan across specialties
- **Medication reconciliation workflows** (hospital-based): Structured processes for identifying medication discrepancies at care transitions
- **Family meeting documentation** (palliative care practices): Recording care decisions and preferences with multiple family members present

### Gap / Opportunity

**Underserved needs:**

1. **Three-generation coordination:** Adult children managing aging parents' care while managing their own health and children's health—a common pattern among participants—need **unified family health management** with role-appropriate views and permissions, not separate portals per family member.

2. **Diagnostic odyssey management:** Patients seeing multiple specialists over months/years without diagnosis need **case management tools** tracking which specialists consulted, what tests ordered, results, hypotheses explored, next steps—creating master narrative that individual specialists don't maintain.

3. **Inter-provider communication facilitation:** Since providers often don't communicate directly, caregivers become information couriers. Opportunity: **provider communication templates** that help caregivers send key information to relevant specialists ("here's what cardiologist found that neurologist should know").

4. **Temporal care intensity adaptation:** Caregiver needs vary dramatically between stable maintenance periods (quarterly appointment tracking) and crisis periods (daily symptom monitoring, multiple weekly appointments). Tools need **crisis mode** with streamlined, essential-only interfaces versus **maintenance mode** with comprehensive features.

5. **Coordination work recognition:** No existing tool makes caregiver labor visible to healthcare teams or payors. Opportunity: **coordination work logging and reports** showing effort invested (hours spent, calls made, appointments coordinated) for insurance appeals, respite service qualification, or simply family acknowledgment.

**Competitor trade-offs:**
- **Health system proxy access:** Provides information access but no coordination tools—caregivers can see patient records but can't organize across multiple providers, track action items, or manage multiple family members efficiently
- **Caregiving social platforms:** Support social coordination (meals, visits) but lack medical information integration—separating caregivers' social support from information management work
- **General productivity tools:** Calendar/task apps are flexible but lack healthcare-specific intelligence (e.g., don't know oncology appointments need pre-appointment lab work scheduled)

**Market white space:**
No consumer platform exists that treats **caregiver as primary user with distinct workflows** rather than as proxy patient. Enterprise care coordination platforms exist (for hospital care managers) but not consumer-facing equivalents.

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as **"caregiver control center"** explicitly recognizing and supporting care coordination as distinct workflow requiring purpose-built tools, not adapted patient tools.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Caregiver-first design:**
   - **Multi-patient dashboards** showing all managed family members with clear visual separation
   - **Responsibility delegation** allowing multiple family members to coordinate care with visible task ownership
   - **Care journal** auto-aggregating appointments, conversations, decisions into searchable timeline (reducing diary-based reconstruction)
   - **Action item tracking** across all providers and family members (explicit TODO lists generated from appointments, test orders, prescription renewals)

2. **Diagnostic odyssey tools:**
   - **Specialist tracker** showing which specialists consulted, when, for what concern, with what outcome
   - **Hypothesis tracking** documenting "what we thought it might be, what was ruled out, what's still uncertain"
   - **Test results integration** with specialist-specific views (show rheumatologist all relevant test results even if ordered by other specialists)
   - **Master timeline** showing progression of symptoms, interventions, results over months/years

3. **Inter-provider communication facilitators:**
   - **Provider summary generator** creating concise, relevant summaries for sharing with new specialists ("here's what's happened so far")
   - **Test result sharing** with provider-appropriate formatting (not just patient portal PDF)
   - **Medication reconciliation reports** for bringing to appointments showing all medications from all providers

4. **Crisis mode interface:**
   - **Simplified crisis dashboard** showing only essentials (this week's appointments, current medications, key contacts)
   - **Quick symptom logging** with minimal friction (voice notes, photo documentation, rapid multiple-choice)
   - **Emergency information packet** instantly generating emergency room summary with current medications, allergies, recent relevant history

5. **Labor visibility tools:**
   - **Coordination work log** automatically tracking appointments attended, calls made, records organized
   - **Impact reports** summarizing caregiving effort for insurance appeals, family discussions, or personal tracking
   - **Respite planning** showing intensity patterns ("you've had 8 medical appointments this month—normal baseline is 2")

**Positioning strategy:**
Market directly to **adult children caring for aging parents** (large, growing demographic with resources) rather than trying to appeal to all caregiver types. Later expand to other caregiver segments (parents of medically complex children, partners managing spouse care).

**Partnership strategy:**
Partner with **senior care organizations, Area Agencies on Aging, caregiver support nonprofits** who already serve target demographic. They become distribution channels while adding value for their communities.

**Revenue model:**
Caregiver tier pricing ($20-30/month) positioned as **time savings subscription**—"your time is valuable; we save you 5+ hours/month of coordination work." ROI clear when compared to caregiver hourly wage.

## DOMAIN 3: Power, Agency & Patient Safety

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Patients face power imbalances causing dismissiveness, trauma-induced information overwhelm, forced decision abdication, and strategic information withholding—creating serious safety risks.

**Design Principle:** *Agency Support, Not Authority Challenge*
Design tools that strengthen patient position in provider relationships without creating adversarial dynamics. Support informed consent, document provider responses, enable selective disclosure, and maintain relationship primacy over information efficiency.

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**
- **Shared decision-making tools:** Evidence-based decision aids helping patients understand treatment options. Primarily used in research settings, minimal real-world adoption. Assume calm, rational decision-making context.
- **Second opinion platforms** (Best Doctors, Grand Rounds): Facilitate expert second opinions but expensive, time-consuming, and focused on complex cases rather than everyday dismissiveness.
- **Patient advocacy organizations:** Provide education and support but labor-intensive, not scalable technology solutions.
- **Audio recording apps:** Some patients record appointments using phones, but this is ad-hoc, not integrated, and may create provider resistance if done without consent.

**Common patterns:**
- **Information provision focus:** Most interventions assume problem is patient knowledge deficit, not power dynamics. Provide more information assuming that will solve issue.
- **Provider-centric solutions:** Decision aids and EMR-integrated tools designed for provider workflow, treating patient engagement as secondary concern.
- **Post-hoc interventions:** Most tools engage after problems occur (second opinions, appeals) rather than preventing issues in real-time.

**Best practices (rare):**
- **Trauma-informed care protocols** (some cancer centers, palliative care): Structured approaches to delivering bad news with support, time, written materials.
- **Patient ombudsman programs** (large health systems): Dedicated advocates helping patients navigate care disputes, but resource-intensive and only in well-resourced systems.
- **Appointment companions** (pilot programs): Trained volunteers accompanying patients to appointments to take notes and ask questions.

### Gap / Opportunity

**Critical unmet needs:**

1. **Real-time credibility support:** Patients need tools that help establish credibility in-the-moment during appointments, not post-hoc appeals. Opportunity: **provider-facing summaries** that are professionally formatted, comprehensive, and lend legitimacy to patient concerns without requiring patient to justify seeking information.

2. **Trauma-informed consent support:** Shocking diagnosis delivery causes information processing impairment, yet no consumer tools exist to help patients navigate this. Opportunity: **decision scaffolding** that breaks complex decisions into manageable steps with cooling-off periods, helping patients who need time to process rather than deciding under duress.

3. **Selective disclosure control:** Patients want granular control over which information shares in which contexts to manage stigma/bias risks, but current tools offer all-or-nothing access. Opportunity: **context-specific sharing** allowing patients to create provider-specific views omitting sensitive information.

4. **Documentation accountability:** Patients report providers not documenting patient-raised concerns. Opportunity: **visit documentation comparison** showing "what you said" versus "what provider documented" with prompts to request corrections.

5. **Power dynamic awareness:** Providers often unaware they're being dismissive or time-pressured. Opportunity: **relationship quality feedback** mechanisms allowing patients to note communication problems in ways that prompt quality improvement without blaming individual providers.

**Competitor trade-offs:**
- **Decision aids:** Excellent for informed choice but assume calm deliberation—fail in trauma states or time pressure
- **Second opinion services:** Address dismissiveness after-the-fact but expensive, slow, and don't prevent initial problem
- **Patient portals:** Provide message functions but these are asynchronous, provider-controlled, and don't address power dynamics in real-time encounters

**Structural barriers:**
This domain faces inherent tension: tools empowering patients may be perceived as threatening by providers, creating adoption resistance. Design must strengthen patient position without appearing to challenge provider authority—difficult balance.

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as **"patient empowerment with provider partnership"** tool—explicitly framing features as supporting both patients and providers by improving communication efficiency and documentation quality. Avoid adversarial framing.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Provider-ready documentation:**
   - **Professional summary generator** creating formatted, comprehensive patient history suitable for presenting to providers
   - **Chief concern framing** helping patients structure concerns in medically legible ways
   - **Question lists** organized by priority and formatted for efficient appointment discussion
   - **Timeline exports** showing symptom progression in clear visual format providers appreciate

2. **Trauma-aware decision support:**
   - **Decision pause feature** allowing patients to explicitly save decision points ("I received diagnosis of X on [date], considering options A and B, decision needed by [date]")
   - **Cool-down prompts** suggesting "this is major news—take time to process before deciding" when serious diagnoses added
   - **Support person involvement** allowing patients to designate family/friends for decision support with shared access to relevant information
   - **Decision criteria clarity** helping patients identify what matters to them (quality of life vs. longevity, side effect tolerance, etc.) before deciding

3. **Granular sharing controls:**
   - **Provider-specific views** allowing patients to create custom summaries for different providers (full history for PCP, relevant subset for specialists)
   - **Stigma-sensitive omission** with patient control over which conditions/medications appear in shared views
   - **Sharing audit logs** showing who accessed what information when (transparency enabling trust)
   - **Temporary sharing** for one-time consultations with automatic expiration

4. **Documentation accountability:**
   - **Visit note comparison** showing patient's pre-appointment summary versus provider's visit note
   - **Missing concern flagging** highlighting patient concerns not documented by provider
   - **Amendment request facilitation** streamlining patient requests to correct/append visit notes
   - **Documentation quality patterns** showing whether providers consistently document patient concerns (quality signal)

5. **Relationship quality feedback:**
   - **Post-visit surveys** asking about communication quality (felt heard? concerns addressed? adequate time?)
   - **Anonymous aggregated feedback** sharing patterns with providers without identifying specific patients
   - **Positive reinforcement** allowing patients to note excellent provider communication for quality improvement recognition

**Critical design constraints:**

- **Provider partnership messaging:** Frame ALL features as "helping providers care better" not "protecting patients from bad providers"
- **Efficiency emphasis:** Highlight time savings for providers (pre-visit summaries reduce history-taking burden)
- **Quality improvement framing:** Position feedback mechanisms as quality improvement tools, not complaint systems
- **Relationship primacy:** Never suggest tools replace provider conversations—always frame as preparing for better conversations

**Rollout strategy:**

Phase 1: **Patient-facing only** (documentation, decision support) without provider integration—prove value to patients first

Phase 2: **Provider-optional sharing** (patients can share summaries if they choose) with explicit provider benefit messaging

Phase 3: **Provider integration** (bi-directional, with provider participation) only after patient adoption critical mass

**Ethical commitments:**

- **No surveillance features:** Explicitly don't build provider rating/review functions that create adversarial dynamic
- **Consent-first recording:** If offering appointment recording/transcription, require explicit provider consent with patient
- **Information sharing control:** Always patient controls sharing—never default-share sensitive information
- **Accessibility priority:** Ensure tools usable by vulnerable populations most likely to face dismissiveness

**Measurement approach:**

Success metrics focus on **relationship quality and patient agency**, not just efficiency:
- Patient confidence in appointments (pre/post adoption)
- Patient perception of being heard (survey)
- Shared decision-making quality (validated instruments)
- Patient participation in care decisions (not abdicating under pressure)
- Patient trust in providers (tracking relationship quality, not undermining it)

## DOMAIN 4: Technology Trust & Adoption

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Patients want consolidated health records but harbor sophisticated concerns about security, accuracy, AI appropriateness, business model sustainability, and relationship impacts—creating conditional, multidimensional trust requirements.

**Design Principle:** *Earn Trust Through Demonstrable Trustworthiness*
Make security practices visible, data quality verification transparent, AI use bounded and explainable, business model clear and aligned with user interests, and relationship impacts positive. Trust isn't demanded; it's earned through accountable practices.

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**

**Security practices:**
- **HIPAA compliance** (standard): Meets minimum regulatory requirements but doesn't differentiate—all healthcare platforms claim HIPAA compliance
- **SOC 2 certification** (emerging): Third-party audit of security practices, increasingly expected by sophisticated users but opaque to general consumers
- **End-to-end encryption** (rare in health records): Technically complex, creates key management burden, uncommon except in highly privacy-focused apps (ProtonMail, Signal)

**AI disclosure:**
- **"Powered by AI" marketing** (common): Vague claims about AI use without specificity about what AI does, accuracy rates, or limitations
- **AI opt-in/opt-out** (rare): Some platforms (Epic MyChart) allow patients to decline AI-assisted features
- **Explainable AI** (research stage): Academic focus on interpretable machine learning but limited real-world implementation in consumer health apps

**Business model transparency:**
- **Privacy policies** (legally required, universally ignored): Long, legal-language documents users don't read
- **Freemium models** (common): Free basic tier with premium upgrades, but often unclear what free tier costs are (data? ads? future payment requirements?)
- **B2B partnerships** (often hidden): Many "free" health apps are employer/insurer-sponsored with unclear data sharing arrangements

**Data quality indicators:**
- **Source citations** (rare): Few platforms show where each data point came from or when retrieved
- **Data freshness indicators** (uncommon): Some portals show "as of [date]" but not consistently
- **Patient correction mechanisms** (legally required under HIPAA but practically difficult): Can request amendments but process burdensome

### Gap / Opportunity

**Underserved needs:**

1. **Comprehensible security:** Users know they should care about security but can't evaluate technical claims. Opportunity: **security-in-plain-language** explaining what protections exist and what risks remain without requiring cryptography expertise.

2. **AI boundaries:** Users make task-specific AI appropriateness judgments but platforms force all-or-nothing AI acceptance. Opportunity: **granular AI consent** allowing acceptance for specific tasks (summarization yes, clinical recommendations no) with clear accuracy disclosure.

3. **Business model clarity:** Users suspicious of "free" platforms don't trust vague privacy policies. Opportunity: **transparent revenue model** explicitly stating "we make money from [X], never from selling your data to [Y]" in non-legal language.

4. **Data provenance:** Users can't tell which information is high-quality (direct from lab) versus uncertain (patient-entered, possibly wrong). Opportunity: **confidence indicators** showing source quality and AI extraction confidence where relevant.

5. **Relationship impact evidence:** Users worry tools might replace provider conversations but lack evidence either way. Opportunity: **relationship quality measurement** showing whether tool use correlates with better or worse patient-provider communication.

**Competitor approaches & limitations:**

- **Apple Health Records security:** Excellent device-level security but non-transparent about what Apple can/can't see, whether data used for other Apple services
- **Epic MyChart:** Widely trusted (used by major health systems) but trust is inherited from health system, not earned by app itself
- **Startup platforms:** Often have good intentions but lack trust indicators (no brand reputation, unclear sustainability, limited security transparency)

**Market patterns:**
- **Security theater:** Many platforms invest in compliance checkboxes without meaningful transparency that builds user confidence
- **AI hype:** Marketing emphasizes AI capabilities without addressing accuracy, limitations, or user control
- **Privacy policy default:** Legally compliant but communicatively useless privacy policies are universal, creating learned helplessness (users ignore them because they're impenetrable)

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as **"radically transparent, user-aligned"** platform that earns trust by making practices visible and demonstrating alignment with patient interests, not just claiming compliance.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Security transparency:**
   - **Plain-language security page** explaining: what's encrypted, who can access what, what we can vs. can't see, what happens if breached
   - **Security incident history** publicly showing any past incidents and responses (transparency about imperfection builds trust more than claimed perfection)
   - **Audit log access** allowing users to see every access to their data (who, when, what)
   - **Regular security reviews** by third parties with public summary reports
   - **Bug bounty program** inviting security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities (demonstrating confidence in security)

2. **AI boundaries & disclosure:**
   - **Task-specific AI consent** allowing users to accept AI for summarization but decline for clinical suggestions
   - **Accuracy disclosure** showing AI performance metrics ("this AI correctly extracts medication names 98% of the time, verified by human review")
   - **AI decision explanations** showing why AI suggested something ("based on symptom pattern matching 87 similar cases")
   - **Human-in-loop commitment** explicitly stating which decisions always have human review versus pure automation
   - **AI model cards** technical documentation (for sophisticated users) about AI training data, limitations, bias testing

3. **Business model transparency:**
   - **Revenue model page** clearly stating: "We make money from [premium subscriptions, B2B partnerships], we never make money from [selling data, advertising]"
   - **Partnership disclosure** showing which health systems, insurers, or employers partner and what data sharing arrangements exist
   - **No surprise payments** explicitly committing "features you use won't suddenly require payment" (addressing freemium bait-and-switch concerns)
   - **Data portability commitment** guaranteeing users can export all data if they leave platform (reducing lock-in concerns)

4. **Data quality transparency:**
   - **Source indicators** showing origin of each data point (EMR, patient-entered, wearable, AI-extracted from document)
   - **Confidence scores** where AI extracts information ("85% confident this is correct—review recommended")
   - **Freshness timestamps** showing when information was last updated from source
   - **Gap highlighting** explicitly noting "we don't have data from [facility] for [timeframe]"
   - **Patient correction workflow** streamlined process for flagging errors with visibility into correction status

5. **Relationship impact measurement:**
   - **Communication quality tracking** surveying whether users feel better prepared for appointments, better understood by providers
   - **Provider feedback** (optional) allowing providers to indicate whether patient-provided summaries were helpful
   - **Conversation time analysis** tracking whether users have longer or shorter appointments post-adoption (testing efficiency vs. relationship quality trade-off)
   - **Public results sharing** publishing aggregated findings about relationship impacts (good or bad)

**Trust-building communication strategy:**

**Don't:**
- Make sweeping security/privacy claims ("100% secure," "completely private")
- Hide behind legal jargon (standard privacy policies)
- Use AI as vague marketing ("AI-powered" without specifics)
- Obscure business model

**Do:**
- Acknowledge limitations ("no system is perfectly secure; here's how we minimize risks")
- Use plain language (high school reading level, no legal jargon)
- Be specific about AI (what it does, accuracy rates, what it doesn't do)
- Be explicit about money ("here's exactly how we make money")

**Regulatory positioning:**

- **Exceed HIPAA requirements** (don't just meet minimum) and explain how
- **Pursue HITRUST certification** (higher bar than HIPAA compliance alone)
- **Support user-directed data donation** for research (with explicit consent) showing pro-social data use
- **Advocate for patient data rights** publicly supporting data portability and user control (demonstrating value alignment)

**Measurement approach:**

Trust is outcome, not directly measurable—measure proxies:
- **Adoption rate** among privacy-concerned users (self-identified in surveys)
- **Feature usage** (do users actually use AI features they worried about?)
- **Data completeness** (do users add sensitive information after initial adoption?)
- **Recommendation rates** (Net Promoter Score specifically from security-conscious users)
- **Security incident response** (user satisfaction with incident handling if breaches occur)

**Innovation opportunity:**

**Zero-knowledge architecture** (technically challenging): Explore end-to-end encryption where platform cannot access user data unencrypted—only user's devices have decryption keys. This creates usability challenges (key management, account recovery) but may differentiate in market by making "we can't access your data" technically verifiable rather than trust claim.

## DOMAIN 5: Accessibility & Inclusive Design

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Users vary dramatically in age, cognitive state (crisis vs. maintenance), health literacy, technology comfort, and device preferences—requiring radically different interfaces, yet most tools optimize for single mythical "average user."

**Design Principle:** *Progressive Disclosure with Multi-Modal Access*
Provide simplified, accessible defaults suitable for elderly users and crisis states while allowing progressive complexity for sophisticated users. Support multiple access modalities (mobile, desktop, paper) recognizing diverse preferences and contexts.

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**

**Accessibility features:**
- **WCAG compliance** (standard): Web Content Accessibility Guidelines addressing visual, hearing, motor, cognitive disabilities—minimum standard, increasingly required for health systems
- **Plain language initiatives** (rare): Some health systems (VA, Mayo Clinic) invest in plain-language patient materials but not consistently across interfaces
- **Large text/high contrast** (common): Standard accessibility features in most apps but often bolt-on rather than core design

**Age-appropriate design:**
- **Senior-focused platforms** (Lively, GrandPad): Simplified devices and interfaces for elderly but healthcare features minimal, focused more on social connection and safety monitoring
- **Caregiver-mediated use** (implicit): Many platforms assume elderly users will have family member helping rather than designing for independent elderly use

**Multi-modal access:**
- **Responsive web design** (standard): Websites that adapt to mobile/desktop screen sizes but often with limited functionality on mobile
- **Mobile-first apps** (common): Apps designed for phones that work poorly on desktop (opposite problem)
- **Print views** (rare): Some portals offer PDF downloads but often poorly formatted for actual printing/reading

**Progressive complexity:**
- **Dashboard customization** (uncommon): Some platforms allow users to configure main screen but limited
- **Beginner/Advanced modes** (very rare): Occasionally seen in highly technical software, almost never in consumer health apps

### Gap / Opportunity

**Underserved needs:**

1. **Crisis-mode simplification:** Users in medical crisis (just received diagnosis, managing acute episode, caregiver overwhelmed) need radically simplified interfaces showing only immediate priorities. Current tools force them to navigate complex interfaces designed for calm exploration. Opportunity: **automatic crisis mode detection** and adaptive simplification.

2. **Cognitive accessibility:** Standard accessibility focuses on physical disabilities; cognitive accessibility (clear language, simple navigation, memory support) less developed. Elderly users and anyone in high-stress situations need **cognitive load reduction** beyond physical accommodations.

3. **Paper-digital bridge:** Significant user segment (elderly, "paper people," cognitive preference) wants paper but current tools offer poorly formatted PDFs or nothing. Opportunity: **high-quality print outputs** and **paper-based input options** (mail in documents, phone-based data entry).

4. **Voice interaction:** Many users (elderly with vision/dexterity issues, users managing multiple tasks, users in cars between appointments) would benefit from voice interaction for simple queries and data entry, but health apps rarely support voice beyond generic system accessibility features. Opportunity: **health-specific voice interfaces** optimized for medical terminology and common tasks.

5. **Literacy-appropriate content:** Health literacy varies dramatically; most platforms write for college education level. Opportunity: **adaptive reading level** that presents information at user-appropriate complexity with option to "explain like I'm 10" versus "show technical details."

**Competitor limitations:**

- **Health system portals:** Designed for general population but practically require health literacy, computer comfort, and cognitive capacity that excludes many
- **Senior-focused devices:** Simplified to point of being patronizing, lacking features sophisticated elderly users want
- **Mobile-first health apps:** Exclude elderly users less comfortable with smartphones and users who need large-screen detail (complex data review)

**Industry patterns:**
- **Youth-centric design:** Most consumer health tech designed by young people for young people, with accessibility as afterthought
- **Digital-first assumption:** Assumes everyone comfortable with digital tools and dismisses paper preferences as resistance to change rather than legitimate preference
- **Single-use-case optimization:** Tools optimized for either mobile or desktop, crisis or maintenance, simple or complex—rarely adapting

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as **"health information for everyone"** platform that truly serves diverse populations rather than optimizing for modal user and treating others as edge cases requiring accommodation.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Adaptive complexity:**
   - **Automatic crisis detection:** When serious diagnosis added or appointment frequency spikes, system offers "simplified view focusing on immediate priorities?"
   - **Simple/Standard/Detailed modes:** User-selectable complexity levels with different feature sets (simple = only essentials, detailed = full power-user features)
   - **Progressive disclosure throughout:** Never show more than 3-5 options on any screen by default, with explicit "show more" for additional options
   - **First-time user flow:** Separate onboarding for "I'm tech-comfortable" versus "I need help" users, routing to appropriate complexity

2. **Cognitive accessibility:**
   - **Plain language everywhere:** All interface text at 6th-8th grade reading level, with "explain in simpler terms" option where needed
   - **Consistent navigation:** Same menu structure throughout app, no hidden features requiring discovery
   - **Visual wayfinding:** "You are here" indicators showing user's location in app hierarchy
   - **Memory support:** Recent items, favorites, customizable home screen with users' most-accessed features
   - **Confirmation dialogs:** For any destructive action (delete, share sensitive info), require explicit confirmation with clear consequence description

3. **Multi-modal excellence:**
   - **True responsive design:** Full feature parity between mobile and desktop with interface optimized for each (not compromised for both)
   - **High-quality print outputs:** Professionally formatted documents suitable for bringing to appointments (readable fonts, clear organization, no cut-off text)
   - **Phone-based data entry:** Call center option for entering information by phone (for users uncomfortable with computers)
   - **Document mailing service:** Physical mail-in option for historical records with processing included (premium service)

4. **Voice interface:**
   - **Health-specific voice commands:** "What's my next appointment?" "When did I last see cardiologist?" "Add symptom: headache"
   - **Medical terminology training:** Voice recognition trained on health terms (medication names, symptoms) that generic voice assistants misunderstand
   - **Conversation repair:** When voice misunderstands, offer clarification ("Did you mean prednisone or prednisolone?")
   - **Hands-free operation:** Full voice navigation for users who need hands-free access (driving, disability, multitasking)

5. **Adaptive reading level:**
   - **Automatic simplification:** AI-powered plain language rewriting of complex medical terms with option to "show original"
   - **Layered explanations:** Initial simple explanation with "learn more" expanding to detailed medical information
   - **Analogy generation:** For complex concepts, provide analogies ("This medication works like...")
   - **Visual supplements:** Diagrams, illustrations for users who process visual information better than text

6. **Elderly-specific features:**
   - **Large default text:** Start with larger fonts, high contrast—users can scale down if desired (reverse of typical)
   - **Touch-friendly targets:** Buttons/links large enough for users with reduced dexterity (minimum 44x44 pixels)
   - **Simplified authentication:** Biometric when available, very simple password requirements otherwise, recovery options for forgotten credentials
   - **Family assistance mode:** Allowing family members to help without full account access (guide-over-shoulder mode)

**Design research investment:**

- **Elderly user testing:** Regular testing with 70+ users, not just 20-30 year old QA testers
- **Crisis simulation testing:** Test with users under time pressure, cognitive load (not just calm usability lab conditions)
- **Low-literacy testing:** Test with below-average reading level users, not just educated early adopters
- **Paper prototype testing:** Test print outputs with users who will actually print and use them

**Inclusive design principles:**

- **Defaults serve most vulnerable:** When trade-offs required, optimize default for least tech-savvy, oldest, most cognitively loaded users—sophisticated users can customize
- **Never patronizing:** Simplified interfaces shouldn't look childish—clean, clear, professional even when simple
- **Capability recognition:** Don't assume elderly = incompetent; many elderly users very sophisticated, need complexity reduction without condescension
- **Preference respect:** Paper preference is valid, not backwards—support it genuinely

**Measurement approach:**

- **Adoption diversity:** What % of users are 65+? How does this compare to health system demographics?
- **Feature usage by age:** Do elderly users use features at similar rates to younger users? (If not, accessibility problem)
- **Completion rates:** Do users successfully complete key tasks (finding appointment, viewing test result) regardless of age/literacy?
- **Support requests:** Are certain user segments requiring disproportionate help? (Indicates accessibility barrier)

**Innovation opportunity:**

**Adaptive AI interface:** Build AI that learns individual user's comfort level, complexity preference, and common tasks—adapting interface over time. Heavy feature user sees more options; simple user sees only basics. Interface evolves with user rather than requiring explicit configuration.

## DOMAIN 6: System Integration & Healthcare Navigation

### User Need → Design Principle

**User Need:** Healthcare systems fragment care across providers without coordination, creating patient burden to navigate complexity, bridge information gaps, and advocate for appropriate care—requiring tools that support navigation, not just information access.

**Design Principle:** *Patient as System Integrator*
Recognize patient's essential role integrating fragmented care and build tools that support this integration work: preparing for appointments, communicating across providers, tracking diagnostic journeys, and identifying coordination gaps.

### Current Landscape

**Existing approaches:**

**Care coordination platforms (enterprise):**
- **Epic Care Everywhere, Carequality:** Provider-facing interoperability networks allowing EMR systems to query each other—not patient-facing
- **Health Information Exchanges (HIEs):** Regional/state networks aggregating patient data across institutions—physician-accessed, patients typically can't directly access
- **Care management platforms** (Athenahealth, Cerner): Provider tools for managing complex patient panels—closed to patients

**Patient-facing navigation:**
- **Symptom checkers** (WebMD, Ada Health): Help users understand symptoms and when to seek care but don't integrate with actual care received
- **Provider search tools** (Zocdoc, Healthgrades): Help find providers but don't support care coordination once found
- **Appointment scheduling** (integrated in some portals): Can book appointments within single health system but not across systems

**Decision support:**
- **Clinical decision support (CDS):** Provider-facing tools suggesting diagnoses, treatment options based on patient data—not patient-accessible
- **Shared decision-making aids:** Patient-facing tools for specific decisions (surgery vs. watchful waiting) but limited integration with patient's actual health data

### Gap / Opportunity

**Critical unmet needs:**

1. **Appointment preparation:** Patients need help preparing for appointments—understanding purpose, gathering relevant history, formulating questions—but this work currently self-directed without support. Opportunity: **appointment-specific preparation tools** that generate relevant summaries, suggest questions based on appointment type.

2. **Cross-provider communication:** When specialists don't communicate, patients must manually transfer information. Opportunity: **provider communication facilitation** tools generating appropriate summaries for specific specialties based on patient's complete history.

3. **Diagnostic journey tracking:** Patients seeing multiple specialists for unexplained symptoms lack master tracking of hypotheses, tests, results. Opportunity: **diagnostic investigation tools** helping patients maintain narrative thread across fragmented specialist visits.

4. **Care gap identification:** Patients unaware of screening/preventive care they should receive or coordination gaps between providers. Opportunity: **proactive care gap alerts** analyzing patient history and flagging "you should discuss mammogram with PCP" or "cardiologist and endocrinologist prescribing potentially interacting medications."

5. **Second opinion preparation:** Seeking second opinions requires comprehensively communicating first opinion without bias. Opportunity: **objective case presentation tools** generating neutral summaries suitable for second opinion consultations.

6. **Healthcare system literacy education:** Patients don't understand how healthcare systems work—when to use urgent care vs. ER, how referrals work, why testing takes time. Opportunity: **embedded education** explaining system logic in context of patient's actual experiences.

**Competitor limitations:**

- **Provider portals:** Show patient's data within single institution but don't support cross-institutional coordination
- **Symptom checkers:** Provide generic guidance disconnected from patient's actual care team and history
- **Care coordination platforms:** Exist but are provider-facing, enterprise-only, expensive—no consumer equivalent

**Market white space:**
No consumer platform exists that **actively supports patient as care coordinator** rather than just passively providing information access. Opportunity to build "care coordination assistant" rather than just "health record viewer."

### Implication for Us

**Strategic positioning opportunity:**
Position as **"care coordination copilot"** that actively helps patients navigate fragmented healthcare systems, not just stores information.

**Differentiation moves:**

1. **Intelligent appointment preparation:**
   - **Appointment-type recognition:** Identify appointment type (annual physical, specialist consult, procedure follow-up) and generate type-appropriate preparation
   - **Relevant history auto-extraction:** Pull most recent labs, medications, symptoms related to this appointment type
   - **Question suggestions:** Based on appointment type and patient history, suggest questions patients might want to ask
   - **Provider communication style guidance:** If provider is known (repeated visits), suggest communication approaches ("Dr. X appreciates concise summaries" or "Dr. Y welcomes detailed questions")

2. **Cross-provider communication tools:**
   - **Specialist-specific summaries:** Generate summaries emphasizing information relevant to specialty (cardiac history for cardiologist, medication list for pharmacist)
   - **Test result routing:** Identify "cardiologist should see these cardiac enzyme results even though ordered by PCP"
   - **Care team awareness:** Show patient's care team (all providers involved) with suggestions for who should coordinate ("suggest requesting PCP coordinate with specialists")

3. **Diagnostic journey support:**
   - **Investigation tracker:** Capture "chief complaint: [shortness of breath], specialists consulted, tests ordered, results, hypotheses considered, next steps"
   - **Timeline integration:** Show diagnostic journey events on main timeline clearly distinguishing "still investigating" from "diagnosed"
   - **Pattern recognition:** Flag when investigation seems stalled ("3 months without new testing or diagnosis—consider asking PCP for next steps")
   - **Second opinion timing:** Suggest when second opinion appropriate based on journey length and severity

4. **Care gap identification:**
   - **Preventive care reminders:** Based on age, sex, conditions, when patient due for screenings (mammogram, colonoscopy, A1C if diabetic)
   - **Medication reconciliation alerts:** Flag potential interactions or duplications when multiple providers prescribing
   - **Follow-up tracking:** Note when test ordered but result not reviewed with patient ("lab from 3 weeks ago—has provider discussed with you?")
   - **Specialist coordination gaps:** Identify when specialists managing overlapping issues without apparent coordination

5. **Healthcare system literacy support:**
   - **Contextual education:** When user encounters confusing aspect (why can't I see notes immediately after appointment?), provide brief explanation of system logic
   - **Navigation guidance:** Suggest appropriate care venues ("For [symptoms], urgent care appropriate—ER unnecessary unless [criteria]")
   - **Process expectations:** Help set realistic expectations ("MRI results typically take 3-5 days; specialist appointment wait times typically 2-6 weeks in your area")

6. **Second opinion facilitation:**
   - **Neutral case summaries:** Generate objective presentation of case without biasing toward first opinion
   - **Complete record package:** Compile all relevant test results, images, reports for sharing with second opinion provider
   - **Question framework:** Help patient articulate what they want from second opinion ("confirm diagnosis? evaluate treatment options? assess provider competence?")

**Integration requirements:**

This domain requires **intelligent analysis of patient data**, not just display—requires AI capabilities:
- **Medical knowledge graph:** Understanding relationships between conditions, medications, specialties
- **Appointment type classification:** Recognizing appointment purposes from descriptions, provider types
- **Clinical guideline implementation:** Encoding preventive care guidelines to identify gaps
- **Natural language generation:** Creating human-readable summaries optimized for different audiences (patients, providers, different specialties)

**Partnership strategy:**

- **Primary care physicians:** Position as tool that helps patients arrive prepared, reducing PCP coordination burden
- **Specialists:** Demonstrate value of receiving pre-appointment summaries (more efficient encounters)
- **Care coordinators:** Partner with care coordination programs to extend their reach through technology

**Measurement approach:**

- **Appointment preparedness:** Survey whether users feel better prepared for appointments
- **Provider feedback:** Do providers find patient-generated summaries useful? (Optional provider survey)
- **Care gap closure:** Are users completing preventive care at higher rates?
- **Coordination improvement:** Are users experiencing better coordination (fewer duplicate tests, better specialist communication)?

**Innovation opportunity:**

**Proactive care orchestration:** Move beyond reactive information management to proactive coordination suggestions: "Your cardiologist increased medication; you should inform PCP" or "Three specialists managing overlapping issues—consider requesting care conference."

# 6. SYNTHESIS & STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

## Integrated Strategic Framework

The six design implication domains interconnect to form a comprehensive strategic framework:

**Foundation:** **Information Integration** (Domain 1) solves fragmentation creating all other problems—must be solid before higher-level features matter.

**Support Layer:** **Care Coordination** (Domain 2) and **System Navigation** (Domain 6) reduce labor burden created by fragmentation—supporting patient work that shouldn't be necessary but is.

**Trust Layer:** **Technology Trust** (Domain 4) and **Accessibility** (Domain 5) address adoption barriers—users won't use tools they don't trust or can't use.

**Safety Layer:** **Power Dynamics & Safety** (Domain 3) addresses critical issues that information tools alone can't solve but can support—strengthening patient position without requiring system change as prerequisite.

## Differentiation Strategy

**Core differentiation thesis:** Current personal health record platforms fail by treating information management as **technical interoperability problem** rather than **human coordination problem**. They solve data aggregation (partially) while ignoring that patients need support for invisible labor, power imbalances, trust building, and navigation—not just data access.

**Our differentiation:**
1. **Caregiver-first design:** Explicitly designing for care coordination use cases, not just individual patient information access
2. **Comprehensive integration:** Solving cross-border, historical, multi-format information challenges competitors avoid

# 7. CONCLUSION

This qualitative research reveals that **personal health records must be reconceived not as information repositories but as tools for managing invisible labor, navigating power imbalances, and coordinating fragmented care**. Current solutions treat healthcare information management as a technical problem when it's fundamentally a human problem—patients aren't failing to access information because of technical barriers alone but because healthcare systems create exhausting coordination burdens, power imbalances that require defensive strategies, and complexity exceeding human cognitive capacity.

The six critical domains identified—information integration, care coordination, power dynamics, technology trust, accessibility, and system navigation—interconnect to form a comprehensive design framework. Solutions must address all dimensions simultaneously; partial solutions (e.g., better information access without coordination support, comprehensive features without accessibility) will fail to serve users' actual needs.

**Most critically, this research uncovers serious patient safety issues**—catastrophic diagnosis communication failures, medication errors with accountability gaps, strategic information withholding due to bias concerns—that are largely invisible to healthcare quality improvement efforts focused on measurable institutional metrics. These safety issues arise from structural problems (fragmentation, time pressure, power imbalances) that information tools alone cannot solve but can help address by strengthening patient position, supporting agency, and facilitating coordination.

**The market opportunity lies not in building a better EMR viewer but in creating the first true care coordination platform for consumers**—tools that support patients and caregivers in the essential integration work that healthcare systems demand but fail to support. By focusing initially on caregivers managing aging parents—a segment with acute needs, resources, and willingness to pay—and building outward to broader populations, there is strategic opportunity to differentiate from institution-centric incumbents while addressing real-world complexity that users face.

Success requires earning trust through demonstrable trustworthiness (transparency, user control, privacy practices), serving diverse populations through genuine accessibility (not just compliance), and recognizing that healthcare is fundamentally relational—tools must support, never replace, the patient-provider relationships that remain central to care quality and patient experience.
