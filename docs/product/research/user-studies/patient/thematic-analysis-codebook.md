- **1.1a: Multi-Provider Silos** - Different providers maintaining separate records
- **1.1b: Geographic Barriers** - Loss of records when moving between provinces/countries
- **1.1c: Format Fragmentation** - Incompatible formats (paper, digital, different systems)

**Example Quotes:**

1. **P07-CC:** "You know, like you said, it's very scattered. There's some stuff I can find in Health Gateway, but it's very generic, you know, like it'll say I went for a hospital procedure, but it won't say that that was a colonoscopy or any of that kind of level of detail."

2. **P05-MB:** "I think for me and this is I think really specific because I moved across provinces is that I don't have anything like I don't think they share any information once you sign up for like a new you know a new health care system in a new province. I don't think any records are shared interproincially."

# CODING GUIDELINES

## General Principles:

1. **Multiple Codes:** Segments can receive multiple codes if they address multiple themes. Always identify the primary code and note secondary codes.

2. **Context Matters:** Always consider the full context of statements. A single quote may contain elements of multiple codes.

3. **Boundary Cases:** When uncertain between codes:
   - If about personal experience with scattered info → 1.1 (Fragmentation)
   - If about providers not communicating → 6.2 (Interoperability)
   - If about valuing relationship → 3.1 (Human Connection)
   - If about insufficient time → 3.2 (Time Constraints)
   - If about AI specifically → 4.1 (AI Concerns)
   - If about data accuracy generally → 4.3 (Data Quality)

4. **Excluded Content:** Do not code:
   - Interviewer questions or prompts
   - Clarifications without substantive content
   - Technical difficulties or meeting logistics

5. **Critical Codes:** Codes marked with 🚨 represent patient safety issues and should be flagged for immediate attention.
