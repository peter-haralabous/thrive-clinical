<!-- This is your executive summary of the entire prototyping journey -->

### What We're Validating

**From discovery.md, we need to validate**:
- [ ] [Assumption 1 from discovery.md: e.g., "Users will change their workflow"]
- [ ] [Assumption 2: e.g., "Real-time updates are valued over batch"]
- [ ] [Assumption 3: e.g., "Visual dashboard preferred over list view"]

**From PRD hypothesis**:
> "We believe that [hypothesis from PRD]"

**Key questions we're answering**:
1. [Question 1: e.g., "Can users complete the core workflow without training?"]
2. [Question 2: e.g., "Do users understand the value proposition?"]
3. [Question 3: e.g., "Is the interaction model intuitive?"]
