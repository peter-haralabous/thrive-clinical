**Location**: Vancouver, BC
**Practice Setting**: Split between hospital inpatient service and community-based internal medicine clinic
**Involvement Level**: Highly involved in technology adoption and workflow optimization

### Biography
Dr. Ayesha Malik is an Internal Medicine specialist practicing in Vancouver, dividing her time between the hospital and her outpatient clinic. Her patient population includes adults with complex, multi-morbid conditions—heart failure, diabetes, frailty, chronic lung disease, and post-hospital transitions.

Each day, she juggles dozens of tasks across disconnected systems: reviewing faxed referrals, logging into multiple EMRs, reconciling incomplete discharge summaries, and following up on patients waiting months for consultation. Despite the growing role of digital health tools, she still relies on manual triage lists, phone calls, and paper forms to fill the gaps between hospital and community care.

The administrative overhead eats into clinical time. Despite this, she maintains high professional standards, valuing accurate documentation, continuity, and clear communication. She's skeptical of "smart" digital tools that claim to help but add more clicks and complexity. She wants systems that adapt to her workflow, not the other way around.

## Allied Health Professionals

### Marcus Chen (Composite)
**Role**: Clinical Exercise Physiologist & Team Manager
**Experience**: 10+ years
**Current Practice**: Lifespan (Preventative Health Clinic)
**Previous Role**: Team Manager at Telus Health (6 years, managing 10 people)

#### Biography
Marcus is a clinical exercise physiologist working in preventative health assessments. His role involves collecting extensive physiological data and creating comprehensive movement assessments. Previously a team manager for 6 years, he developed workflows and EMR templates focused on standardized individualization—ensuring consistency across the team while allowing flexibility for personalized care.

As someone deeply invested in data-driven healthcare, Marcus has become a subject matter expert in EMR design, particularly in how to structure clinical information as data points rather than static text. He's passionate about efficiency from a clinical perspective and has designed systems with 1,000-1,500 custom data points to make information truly usable and transferable between providers.

#### Personality Traits
- Data-driven and systematic
- Innovative in workflow design
- Efficiency-focused
- Collaborative
- Tech-savvy but pragmatic

#### Goals
- Minimize duplicate work between providers seeing the same patient over time
- Design EMR systems where data is malleable and movable, not "going to die" in text notes
- Create standardized workflows that still allow for individualization
- Access key patient information quickly through dashboard-style interfaces
- Save time on administrative tasks to focus on patient care
- Bridge the gap between patient and clinician with better information systems

#### Current Workflow

**Pre-Visit:**
- 90-question digital questionnaire sent via CHR's QRS system (takes patients 10-20 minutes)
- Questionnaire answers automatically populate as data points in provider notes

**Assessment Day (4-5 hours):**
- Vitals collection
- Ultrasound imaging
- 1 hour with physician
- 1 hour exercise physiology assessment
- Data collection focused on quantitative measurements

**Follow-Up Day:**
- 1 hour with exercise physiologist
- 1 hour with physician
- 1 hour with dietitian

**Post-Visit:**
- Writes recommendations in chart note
- Copy/pastes recommendations to send via EMR message to patient
- Patients remember "about a third" of what was discussed, so written summary is critical

#### Frustrations

**EMR Limitations:**
- Previous EMR (Met Access) was "garbage"—not flexible from a data perspective
- Text written into chart notes "goes to die"—can't be used for anything afterward
- If different providers see the same patient in subsequent years, they duplicate all the work from previous visits
- Have to click into each chart note individually to see what was discussed, rather than having a consolidated view

**Data Access Issues:**
- Doesn't have CareConnect access as an exercise physiologist (tried to get it but unsuccessful)
- Must ask MOA to search CareConnect, download PDFs, upload to EMR, and flag for review
- CareConnect has hospital/inpatient data but not outpatient specialist visits
- "Going fishing"—don't know what information exists for a patient
- Patients don't know what investigations they've had or when

**Information Inefficiency:**
- Everyone reviews the same PDFs multiple times—incredibly inefficient
- No standardized way to translate information from investigations and consult notes
- Example: 5 cardiac tests + 2 cardiology consults = clicking through 7 different PDFs
- Manual, fragmented process with multiple download/upload steps

**Workflow Gaps:**
- Need to manually contextualize information from multiple sources
- Difficult to track longitudinal data over time
- No automated way to pull key information forward for next provider

#### Needs

**Data Structure:**
- Treat every aspect of care as a data point (qualitative or quantitative)
- Make information malleable—able to move around and pull into different views
- Data points should auto-populate in other providers' notes when relevant
- Custom data fields for specialty-specific information (e.g., musculoskeletal injury history)

**Dashboard & Visualization:**
- Three-tier approach: "Lay summary → Abstract → Detailed view" (like PhD dissertation structure)
- Main dashboard shows key information at a glance
- Ability to click into categories for more detail
- Final level shows original PDFs when needed
- Example: "Cardiac risk: YES" → click to see risk factors and exam summaries → click to see specific PDF

**Information Extraction:**
- Standardized extraction from investigations and consult notes into tabular format
- Table showing all cardiac investigations with key data points
- Table showing summary of cardiology consults
- AI-assisted extraction with subject matter expert training

**Integration:**
- Data from questionnaires automatically feeding into provider templates
- Ability to send chart notes/PDFs that get digested and integrated back into the system
- Information should flow bidirectionally without manual re-entry

#### Technology Stack

**Current EMR:** CHR (Telus Collaborative Health Record)
- Created 1,000-1,500 custom data points
- Data points can be: numerical, single-line text, multi-line text, single dropdown, multiple dropdowns
- Designed from data perspective—everything is structured
- Built custom workflows and templates

**Other Systems:**
- QRS (questionnaire system within CHR)
- CareConnect (provincial health information system)—no access
- Various imaging and diagnostic equipment

#### Pain Points by Workflow Stage

**1. Pre-Assessment Data Gathering:**
- Must rely on MOA to access CareConnect
- Don't know what's available until searching
- Missing outpatient specialist notes
- Patients don't remember their investigation history

**2. During Assessment:**
- Need to review multiple systems/PDFs during consultation
- Information not contextualized or summarized
- Previous provider's work not easily accessible

**3. Documentation:**
- Time spent on manual data entry
- Creating summaries for patients (but this is valued)
- Ensuring data is in right structure for future use

**4. Follow-Up:**
- Next provider must duplicate work if they don't have structured data access
- Longitudinal tracking is manual

#### Decision-Making Process

**For Technology Adoption:**
- Must solve a specific problem with measurable benefit
- Prefers to design things he would want to use himself
- Values both standardization and flexibility
- Needs to see how it integrates with existing workflow
- Focused on clinical efficiency, not just features

**Influence Factors:**
- Subject matter expertise—wants to configure systems himself
- Evidence of time savings
- Ability to customize to specialty needs
- Whether it makes information more accessible vs. creating more work

#### Views on AI

**Supportive If:**
- Has specific purpose defined by clinical experts
- Uses expertise to develop intelligence ("teach AI how to extract information the way I would")
- Allows for review and revision of outputs
- Makes information extraction and visualization faster

**Key Philosophy:**
"Generative AI doesn't mean smart AI. You can teach something to be dumb. I would be supportive in settings where you have a specific purpose and can use expertise to develop the intelligence."

**Potential Use Cases:**
1. **Chart Reviews:** Set up patient dashboard with key information he wants to see
2. **Information Extraction:** Train AI to extract specific data from investigations/consults
3. **Note Writing:** Generate draft recommendations based on assessment data (with review)
4. **Data Visualization:** Create summary tables from multiple PDFs

**Concerns:**
- Patient may lack clinical language in self-reported data
- Medical provider's notes capture subjective experience better than patient can
- Need human interaction option for some patients (not everyone comfortable with AI chat)
- Clinicians may resist if they feel something is "doing their job"

#### Vision for Ideal Solution

**"Banking App for Health":**
- Central repository where patient's information lives
- Different visualizations for different users (patient vs. clinician)
- Patient can grant clinician login to view their dashboard
- Clinician can download summaries or upload their notes back to the system
- AI digests PDFs and integrates information automatically
- Bridges the gap between patient, clinician, and multiple EMR systems

**Not trying to:**
- Replace all EMRs
- Become the primary documentation system for clinicians

**Trying to:**
- Give information "a home to live in"
- Make information effectively digested by both patients and clinicians
- Bridge between clinician's EMR and patient

**Key Requirements:**
- Must make sense financially/business-wise
- Needs tiered pricing (local storage vs. cloud, individual vs. clinic)
- Clinicians won't interact beyond download/copy-paste unless it's their primary EMR
- Focus on filling the gap that currently exists—nothing serves this space well

#### Quotes

- "Text just goes to die [in chart notes] because it doesn't go anywhere, right?"
- "I hate how a lot of EMRs when you write text into a chart note... it can't be used for anything."
- "You're going fishing and you don't know what you're totally going to catch."
- "The space that's missing is that in between the patient and the clinician."
- "Generative AI doesn't mean smart AI. You can teach something if you teach something to be dumb it will be dumb."
- "The one thing people always want to feel is cared for."
- "I would buy it. That's what I'm looking for. If you can fill that space with a good product, that can be really impactful on people's lives."

#### Technology Comfort
**Level**: Very High - Subject matter expert in EMR design, created custom data architecture

#### Workflow Innovation
- Designed entire clinic workflow from data perspective
- 1,000-1,500 custom data points
- Pre-population of provider notes from patient questionnaires
- Specialty-specific data tracking (e.g., musculoskeletal injury history)
- Focus on making data transferable between providers and visits

#### Patient Population
- Preventative health assessments
- Generally health-conscious individuals
- Wide age range
- Some with cardiac history requiring additional screening
- Occasional older patients with cognitive challenges who need phone-based intake

#### Collaboration Needs
- Works with nurses, physicians, dietitians
- Needs seamless data sharing within multidisciplinary team
- Values when his data auto-populates in other providers' views
- Wants bi-directional information flow
