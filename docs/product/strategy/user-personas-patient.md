As Eleanor was able to weight-bear and her pain was manageable with medications, she was given pain medication and discharged home the same night.

Her discharge instructions included to rest, and follow up with her family doctor. She was told that she could consider getting a walker if she felt like she needed mobility support, but no home supports were arranged, and she was not formally assessed for mobility aids or home care services before discharge.

## Complex Patients

### Dave Thompson
**Age**: 77
**Gender**: Male
**Status**: Retired, Widower
**Family**: Children: Emily (45), Matthew (50)
**Living Situation**: Lives alone in Vancouver

#### Biography
Dave has had increasing pain and mobility issues with osteoarthritis of his left hip. He had been scheduled for a hip replacement but that has been delayed due to long waitlists and increasing health issues.

Dave has had two strokes over the last five years, for which he has largely recovered. One and a half years ago, Dave fell down a flight of stairs. When he was taken to the ED, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation (likely the cause of his fall). His recovery was complex: he developed pneumonia and there was deterioration of his left hip. He required a long recovery period at the UBC Complex Activation Medical Unit (CAMU) and was eventually discharged with twice-a-day homecare services, occupational therapy (OT) and physiotherapy (PT).

Once Dave was able to manage his own ADLs, he was discharged from the homecare and rehab services. He did not keep up with his exercise programs due to the pain and decreased mobility from his hip. His daughter, Emily, continued to support her father with his IADLs. Dave has been becoming increasingly frail and his children have been talking to him about going into assisted living.

Two months ago, Dave fell at home and could not get up. He had pressed his LifeLine and was taken back to hospital. Surprisingly, he had not broken his affected hip but his mobility was suddenly worse. Eventually he was sent back to UBC CAMU for rehabilitation but he was not progressing toward a discharge. His voice was becoming raspy and a neck and lung x-ray was completed showing a mass in his neck. That was biopsied, and pathology results are pending.

With the likely diagnosis of a life-threatening cancer and a low probability that rehabilitation will make a difference, Dave is to be discharged home tomorrow with home care services, initiated by the CAMU CML. Appointments were made at BC Cancer with a medical oncologist and radiation oncologist in two weeks.

With Dave's increasing frailty, Emily and Matthew are worried that their father will not be able to manage at home for very long and not be able to tolerate cancer treatments. They want to know more about what BC Cancer can provide regarding support, pain and symptom management, and diet. They are thinking ahead and want to know more about palliative care and hospice and end-of-life planning. Emily and Matthew are overwhelmed with all that will come next.

#### Challenges
