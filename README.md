[![Built with Cookiecutter Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Cookiecutter%20Django-ff69b4.svg?logo=cookiecutter)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/)

## Quickstart

```shell
make dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

All emails that the app sends will be viewable at http://localhost:8025

## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a
  "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to [mailpit](http://localhost:8025) to see the emailed message. Follow the verification link and
  the user will be ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar),
so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
