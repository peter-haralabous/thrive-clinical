[![Built with Cookiecutter Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Cookiecutter%20Django-ff69b4.svg?logo=cookiecutter)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/)

## Quickstart

```shell
make dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

All emails that the app sends will be viewable at http://localhost:8025

## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    uv run mypy sandwich

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    uv run coverage run -m pytest
    uv run coverage html
    uv run open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    uv run pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally.html#using-webpack-or-gulp).

### Custom Bootstrap Compilation

The generated CSS is set up with automatic Bootstrap recompilation with variables of your choice.
Bootstrap v5 is installed using npm and customised by tweaking your variables in `static/sass/custom_bootstrap_vars`.

You can find a list of available variables [in the bootstrap source](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v5.1.3/scss/_variables.scss), or get explanations on them in the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/).

Bootstrap's javascript as well as its dependencies are concatenated into a single file: `static/js/vendors.js`.

### Testing Docker builds

```shell
docker build -t sandwich .
docker run \
  -e DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production \
  -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=secret \
  -e DJANGO_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=bucket-name \
  -e "DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*" \
  -e DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=false \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -p 3000:5000 \
  --rm sandwich
```
